Vision
At Baseform, we’ve combined years of applied R&D in water systems with a just as valuable track record in advanced computer development and implementation.
Since Baseform's inception in January 2015, we’ve rapidly gained a leading position in the markets where we are present, and owe it to not losing sight of a few seminal notions:
water networks are not sets of pipes, they are living organisms that jointly provide a service – we focus on making sure utilities provide the service 24/7, now and in the long run;
public infrastructures have to last beyond us, and the changes that each generation can introduce are very limited;
the software tools available on the market – billing, inventory, SCADA, maintenance – are good at their respective roles; but they scatter data, processes and sources of information away from the key decisions;
daily operation is an attention-sapper; operational decisions, planning efficiency and long-term corporate objectives have little chance of effectively aligning, unless something is done right at the root of the problem.
We have been successful at making better use of the data the utilities and cities already collect daily, and at targeting the key decisions (short- & long-term) with the right calculations, the right metrics, incorporating them in routine life.
Our site reflects a set of ideas that provide the context for the family of apps we make available to utilities, cities and the community. We believe this vision and our software can make a difference, in the water sector but also to the way in which cities make use of this ever less abundant resource.
About cities
Metropolitan areas concentrate 80% of the US population today. In 30 years, the UN estimates the same proportion will apply to the entire globe. Designing and managing cities and their infrastructures has never been so complex, and crucial.
One thing is for sure, the existing designs and design praxis must be bettered. Cities are not collections of infrastructural assets, much less static landscapes. Cities are people and we at Baseform see them move and change throughout the day, week, season, year, across each urban area.
Cities are the greatest constraints to the delivery of an infrastructural service – utilities take on a challenge that is in reality a societal challenge. Public infrastructures are there to provide a service to city dwellers, essentially in the buildings where they live, work or play. Managing cities and their infrastructures is all about understanding citizens, the places where they dwell and the way they behave, across time and space, at all times.
Growing sensorization and ubiquitous data
Knowing is a lot better than believing. As sensors multiply, we can combine data sources like never before, to reach a better understanding of human behaviors and levels of activity around the city, throughout the day and the year.
Engineering, architecture and urban planning are undergoing a fundamental revolution, where instead of relying only on projected versions of reality as in the past few centuries (models, in 20th century jargon), we can now increasingly observe that reality in detail and continuously adapt the designed landscape, facilities, infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
As far as public water infrastructures go, those needs are evidently ever changing. Not just the emerging, uncertain challenges of climate change, energy crises and their ilk, but the actual everyday fact. The short movie above, extracted from our database of over 1500 years of human consumption in cities around the world, suggests how any static urban zoning or strategic plan can easily miss reality and become a problem rather than the solution.
Ailing infrastructure
The useful life of water infrastructure pipes may range from over a century to less than a couple of decades. Cities need to re-invest accordingly. Not doing so is like not paying a bank loan – it builds up. In the US alone, the current deferred investment gap is estimated to surpass $60bn. Most major cities, with infrastructures built many decades ago, experience issues such as water shortages, leakage, tariff increases, water quality hazards.
The massive investments which are inevitably needed require long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes.
The darker blue bars in the chart show annual investment in a US city’s public water infrastructure, from its inception in the 1950s. The initial investment is mostly incorporated in the price of housing and thus borne by the initial property buyers. The white bars show current annual maintenance & rehab expenditure, at adequate levels by industry standards.
What modern society by and large has not experienced yet, is the rebound of those investment booms, as large numbers of pipes reach the end of their service lives and must be replaced (bright blue bars). This time around, the cost will not be diluted elsewhere, and the city must find ways to face expenditure needs well above the current ‘good practice’ rehab rates.
Networked infrastructures are not simply collections of assets. Extracting the best service out of capital and operational expenditure is not the same as replacing older cars in a rental fleet. Networks behave like networks; relative position and function matter. In order to maximize expenditure efficiency, we need to take into consideration the finance, the risk, but also the performance, the hydraulics, and above all, the service, where it’s delivered, and its recipients.
Technology is hardly a silver bullet, but it can help. The key are clear objectives, a good notion of how to measure them, and the will to make the right decisions.

Product
Baseform's SaaS makes available a growing family of apps through each customer deployment. Apps bring together sets of tools that leverage their combined functionality around a specific decisional or engineering process. The platform ensures a consistent user experience and a natural integration of data & results.
Product
City: dynamic 3d spatial+time analytics
Monitor: real-time operational efficiency
Diagnose: network analytics
Predict: risk analytics
Plan: time and space prioritization
Predict: risk analytics
Predict: asset analytics
Uncover more about your assets: predict asset service life; uncover reliability & condition patterns;extract more from asset records, geodata, failure records/work orders, inspections; forecast service risk

Failure analysis
Using GIS data and pipe failure records, such as work orders, predicts present and future failure rates of pipes or sewers.
Predicts individual probability of failure at any point in time.
Correlates with a user-configurable open range of potential explanatory factors
Prioritizes for action and tests renewal strategies against past failure history

Inspection Analysis
Using pipeline/sewer inspection and condition assessment records, predicts future condition, residual life, and guides the inspection effort.
Uses pipe/sewer inventory data and failure records [e.g. work orders).
Other covariates may be supplied as geodata.
Projects the effect of age on condition & estimates confidence levels for the predictions.
Measures the value of potential explanatory variables.

Component Importance
Assesses the consequence of failure of each pipe in a water supply network, by simulating the resulting reduced service.
Calculates the individual importance of each pipe by comparing the total demand that the network is hydraulically capable of satisfying when that pipe is down, with the total demand supplied by the unimpaired network.
Capable of computing the effect over extended periods (e.g., the 24h cycle).
Results available in 2D or 3D mapping visualization, alongside all hydraulic results.

Risk of no service
Quantifies supply service interruption risk through expected reduced service, based on individual pipe failure probabilities and consequences.
Calculates a service interruption risk metric, expressed as the expected volume of demand that the system will be unable to satisfy over one year, caused by the failure of each individual pipe.
Combines results from Failure Analysis and Component Importance.

Failure Analysis Delivering Exceptional Predictive Results
Our Failure Analysis module, just one component in our software portfolio, has been achieving outstanding value for our customers—including one of the 10 largest US cities.
Our machine-learning-based ability to prioritize the pipes most likely to fail in a given time span recently resulted in Baseform winning a blind test of pipe break predictive capability in the scope of a major US city's procurement procedure (by predicting past failures that had been purposefully hidden from the data provided).

In addition to our ability to determine remaining useful life and deterioration curves, we add a much wider range of modules to span the risk, service, and economics angles needed for the most complete prioritization of assets and CIP projects available on the market, aiming at proactive asset management with measurable ROI.

This enables hard advantages at both the operational level—with faster detection of leaking pipes by field crews; more efficient reaction to bursts; reduced operational costs—but also at the tactical and strategic levels, with much improved AM prioritization, more precise CIP costing, expenditure conversion from reactive to proactive, and improved overall OPEX/CAPEX planning and risk management.

The GNU General Public License, or GPL, is an open-source license. Open-source doesn't just mean that you can view the source code — it has a broader philosophical implication. 'Free' is not a statement related to price; rather, it refers to certain freedoms, namely:
freedom to run

Symbolic Outlier Detection applied to the Analysis of Drinking Water Consumption
Thesis
2019
Pedro Borralho
Interval-valued data, symbolic principal component analysis, robust statistics, drink- ing water consumption, water distribution systems.
Principal Component Analysis is a popular statistical method for dimensionality reduction and has been extended to interval-valued data by several authors. Four of this most common symbolic principal components estimation methods have a unified formulation, namely the Centers and Vertices Methods, Complete Information Principal Component Analysis, and Symbolic Covariance Principal Component Analysis. A meticulous simulation study is conducted to compare several robust estimators of symbolic Principal Components for interval data, which use robust symbolic covariance matrices. The robust versions of the four estimation methods in study are compared with their classical counterparts. The simulation study is accompanied by visualisations of the various types of contamination used, which helps to understand what are considered to be outliers in interval data. In addition, an outlier detection method based on robust interval principal components was devel- oped. An initial comparison study was conducted, to assess the performance of the method proposed, in particular to compare with another existing proposal for outlier detection in interval data. The potentialities of the developed methodologies are illustrated with their application to a real- life dataset of drinking water consumption of more than 90 000 clients, served by a large urban water supply system in a Portuguese utility. Using the geographic identification of the clients provided by the utility, the results of the symbolic principal components are also represented in maps through the use of the Baseform software. The outlier detection procedure is used to identify and characterise clients with anomalous consumption behaviours.

STE - A Survival Tree Ensemble : Application to the Prediction of Pipe Failures in Water Supply Systems
Thesis
2019
Inês Oliveira
Infrastructure Asset Management, Water Distribution Systems, Failure Prediction, Machine Learning, Survival Analysis.
Drinking water is provided to the majority of population through a complex water distribution system, which is constantly affected by economic constraints, climate changes, infrastructure deterioration, and increasing urbanisation and customer demand. Hence, water utilities are challenged with a demanding task and, they are forced to venture in long-term strategies which direct their efforts in planning and prioritisation of rehabilitation actions. Despite the common reactive approach in which water utilities base their efforts, they are recently moving towards a more proactive approach and using failure prediction strategies in infrastructure asset management. This project’s goal is to apply machine learning techniques to build prediction models and evaluate their performance when compared to existing approaches such as the one implemented by Baseform. Failure data is characterised by some important specificities, such as recurrent events, left-truncation and right-censoring, which distinguish it from other types of data. Tree-based models emerge as ap- pealing approaches to model time until the next failure, which combine the strengths of survival analysis with the most recent developments in machine learning. To prevent the potential instability caused by individual trees, ensemble techniques arise as an alternative methodology. In pair with the Baseform model, all methods are capable of obtaining equally satisfactory results (sometimes surpassing the existing approaches) and ranking pipes with higher risks of failing. From the work developed so far, it is noticeable that survival analysis combined with machine learning techniques is a broad field of possibilities, which can bring many benefits to failure analysis in water distribution systems.

Infraestructuras de agua, análisis, datos, previsión de fallos, tuberías
La predicción de fallos y la priorización de los esfuerzos en la rehabilitación desempeñan un papel muy importante en el marco de la gestión patrimonial de infraestructuras. En los últimos años han surgido diversos enfoques científicos dirigidos a determinar tiempos de vida y previsión de fallos, con el objetivo de identificar las tuberías más propensas a fallos y ayudar a priorizar rehabilitaciones del sistema. El análisis de fallos de Baseform está diseñado para utilizar los datos reales con sus problemas habituales, combinando herramientas estadísticas de vanguardia con la adquisición continua de datos. Por lo tanto, está preparado para hacer frente a las lagunas de datos y la información inconsistente, y aprovecha al máximo los escenarios de mayor cantidad de datos, siempre y cuando estén disponibles. Este artículo ilustra el análisis de fallos a través de su aplicación real en el Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia (CABB).

asset management, infiltration & inflow., inspections, sewers
For over a decade, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) of Gwinnett County (GA, USA) has developed a robust work order and inspection history within its Computerized Maintenance Management System. DWR has recently taken the next step in this asset management journey, leveraging over 43,000 pipeline inspection records and 30,000 work orders, in conjunction with comprehensive flow monitoring coverage, to 1) predict areas with high probability of operational failure, 2) predict areas with high probability of structural failure, and 3) develop deterioration curves for the various cohorts of pipe, informing the long-term renewal process. This prediction allows DWR to target inspections and proactive O&M where failure is most likely, as well as definitively plan for long-term renewal investment (Suttles et al., 2019). The three components of the approach concurrently evaluate infiltration and inflow (I&I), inspections and work orders, in order to address: (i) excessive I&I, a symptom of structural deterioration and a cause of increased pumping, treatment and reclamation costs, lower efficiencies and service levels, and public and environmental liabilities; (ii) excessive reactive O&M levels, driving higher costs and impacting levels of service (overflows, backups); and (iii) capital expense, crucially tied to controlling asset deterioration and determining how best to prioritize available funds to renew or rehabilitate for maximum sustainability.

The Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources has established an advanced, multi-pronged approach to short- and long-term asset management for its 3,000-mile gravity sanitary sewer system, with the goals of predicting 1) areas with high probability of operational failure, 2) areas with high probability of structural failure, and 3) deterioration curves for the various pipe cohorts, informing the long-term renewal process. An application of software-based analytics is described that represents a step forward in decision-making used to drive asset inspection, maintenance and capital project prioritization. The components above are jointly addressed in a mutually informative, permanently available software, providing clear, defensible, quantified overall prioritization of capital and operational expenses. Advanced analytics are brought together in a multi-criteria, optimized framework designed to continuously update itself and provide both operational and structural support on demand. The paper presents the analytics methods used, a detail of key results and their discussion, and provides an overview of the multi-criteria framework deployed to support the prioritization of assets, sub-basins and projects.

Variable importance, mutual information, random forests, sewer failure prediction models, stepwise search
© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group When defining the variables to predict sewer failure and therefore optimise sewer systems maintenance, it is important to identify the ones that most significantly influence the quality of the predictions or to define the smallest number of variables that is sufficient to obtain accurate predictions. In this study, three different statistical variable selection algorithms are applied for the first time to identify the most important variables for sewer failure prediction: the mutual information indicator, the out-of-bag samples concept, based on the random forest algorithm, and the stepwise search approach. The methods were applied to a real data-set that consists of the categorisation of sewer condition and associated physical characteristics. The mutual information and the stepwise search methods provided good predictions while those obtained using out-of-bag samples based on random forest were somewhat different, justified by the lack of robustness to imbalanced class distributions.

GIS, Water distribution systems, failure prediction, infrastructure asset management, prioritization strategies
The prediction of pipeline and service line failures, and the prioritization of rehabilitation efforts, play an important role in infrastructure asset management. Traditional condition assessment methods for water pipes are commonly associated with time- and resource-consuming tasks, that are either expensive, inaccurate, or both. Often, these physical methods cannot be applied to the entire system, so the results cannot inform the decision-making process in a structured manner. Several scientific approaches focused on lifetime assessment and failure forecasting have emerged in recent years aiming to identify the most failure-prone pipes and help prioritize system rehabilitation actions in a non-invasive but highly informed and utility-specific way. Failure Analysis, like other Baseform apps, is designed for real data with common, everyday problems, combining breakthrough statistical tools with continuous utility data acquisition. It is therefore prepared to cope with data gaps and inconsistent information, and it takes full advantage of more data-rich scenarios if and when they become available. This paper presents some key technological aspects and capabilities available in this application, illustrating them through examples from a case study at a large utility where the software is in daily use.

Infrastructure asset management (IAM) of mature urban water infrastructures should address the overall process of balancing out capital improvement, rehab and operational & maintenance expenditures over the long term, faced with given strategic objectives, translated into service (performance), cost and risk targets. The ability to follow the entire network in its daily management is at the base of structured short- to long- term IAM procedures. When data collection for these purposes is embedded in everyday activity, continuously making available the key metrics used for diagnosis and prioritization of assets, zones and systems, it gains in validation and repeatability and avoids becoming a tedious chore to be undertaken once a year with piecemeal results. Baseform is a web-served SaaS (Software as a Service) environment designed from scratch to aggregate multiple data sources on a continuous basis, in order to make them available specifically to the analytics and procedures required to fully support IAM in the water utility through a process- focused applicational portfolio. This paper presents the main technology aspects and analyses available in the software, the advantages of serving it as SaaS, the benefits of a fast-growing scale, and illustrates the above with concrete real-life cases.

demand pattern, flow metering, leak detection, water distribution systems, water losses
Real-time monitoring of DMA can be a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of water supply systems and reduce losses. However, in large systems it is unrealistic to be permanently attentive to all zones without automatic monitoring tools, assisting the operations teams in thoroughly monitoring the entire network and systematically tracking down, collecting and validating all relevant information produced. Several sophisticated algorithms, based on robust statistical models and historical flow data, are continuously used by Baseform to accurately predict water demand patterns and to establish whether the consumption recorded, during a specific period, is normal or may reveal abnormal events. The strategic concern of the utility with prioritization of DMA and planning of O&M drive a search for reliable mechanisms to detect outliers, i.e., monitored values that lie outside of normality. This paper introduces a procedure for identification of trends in minimum night flow for mid- to long-term horizons, particularly useful in the early detection of ongoing leaks before they escalate into catastrophic bursts. The main advantages of this approach are illustrated through selected cases of detected events that empowered benefits to day-to-day operations, in a large urban water supply system in a Portuguese utility where the software is in use.

IT systems, asset management, big data, decision-making
Infrastructure asset management of mature urban water infrastructures should address the overall process of balancing out capital improvement, rehab and operational & maintenance expenditures over the long term, faced with given strategic objectives, translated into service (performance), cost and risk targets. As sensors and data sources multiply (SCADA, telemetry, AMR, billing, work orders, GIS, inspections, models), urban water networks generate very large amounts of information on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. Engineering, architecture, and urban planning are undergoing a fundamental revolution — instead of relying only on projected versions of reality (often made decades ago), we can now increasingly observe that reality in detail and continuously adapt the designed landscape, facilities, infrastructures, etc., to the changing needs and intensities. Baseform is a web-served SaaS (Software as a Service) environment where a portfolio of process-focused apps are made available to a managed, unlimited universe of users inside the organization. The data are acquired from their sources through automatable upload, avoiding data migration or the need to replace the existing IT systems. This paper presents the main technology aspects and analyses available in the software, the advantages of serving it as SaaS, the benefits of a fast-growing scale, and illustrates the above with concrete real-life cases.

Failure prediction plays an important role in the management of urban water systems infrastructures. An accurate description of the deterioration of urban drainage systems is essential for optimal investment and rehabilitation planning. In the study presented in this paper, a new method to predict sewer pipe failure based on robust decision trees is proposed. Five other different stochastic failure prediction models – the non-homogeneous Poisson process, the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process, classical decision tress (CART and Random Forest algorithms), the Weibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process – are also implemented and explored in order to identify models that combine good failure prediction results with robustness. The six models were tested on the asset register and pipe failure register of a large US wastewater utility; only pipe blockage failures were considered in this study.

Automatic, dynamic parametrization of consumption patterns in water supply

adaptative models, changepoint detection, demand pattern, flow metering, water distribution systems
Several methodologies can be applied to predict the 24-hour demand pattern in district metering areas (DMA) of water distribution systems. However, in most cases, it is essential to know in advance the characteristics of each flow time-series, to choose the most suitable combination of parameters to use as the input of the method. In particular, the demand pattern derived is dynamic and may be influenced by the period of time considered. An adaptive predictive model of the pattern based on some selection criteria, which automatically choose the most appropriate parameterizations is described, in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks. This new approach is built on the concept of weighted percentiles, allowing the prediction to quickly adjust to changes in consumption habits, seasonality and other trends. The proposed procedure has undergone extensive testing and validated through the application to a large number of DMA, as preparation for use in a commercially deployed software.

Infrastructure asset management, Strategic planning, Tactical planning, Urban water services
The requirement to provide continuously the urban water services while infrastructures are ageing, impose the need for increasingly sustainable infrastructure asset management (IAM). To achieve and maintain the adequate levels of service, the AWARE-P IAM methodology has been applied in collaborative projects launched by the National Civil Engineering Laboratory, in partnership with IST (Technical University of Lisbon), Addition (software company) and several water utilities. The objective of these projects is to support urban water utilities in the development, implementation and maintenance of IAM plans. To guarantee the success of IAM planning, following the AWARE-P IAM methodology, utilities are required to: consider that the infrastructure has system behaviour and lifespan is indefinite and guarantee the full-alignment of IAM planning with organisation objectives. By analysing the strategic and tactical plans of participating utilities, the proposed methodology principles are discussed and supported. The main innovation results from the implementation of IAM planning are also presented and discussed, including the challenges of setting up an IAM process, together with the major benefits and drawbacks that come up when developing IAM plans. The results were demonstrated by the effective implementation of 16 strategic and 14 tactical IAM plans by the participating utilities.

Asset management, Decision-making, Long-term, Strategic planning, Tactical planning, Water infrastructure management
Strategic asset management (AM) of urban water infrastructures faces the challenge of dealing with expensive and long-lasting assets of a very diverse nature and wide-ranging useful lives and costs. Typically, utility managers inherit an infrastructure with assets in assorted conditions and stages in their lifecycle. They are expected to manage their value in order to ensure adequate service, and make sure that what they pass on to their successors is capable of continuing to do so. Long-term vision is needed, and sound transition paths must be sought in order to ensure that urban water services are sustainable, without jeopardizing the quality of the service provided during the transition. Focusing on the transition to more sustainable services, the TRUST project revisited the concept of sustainability, explored pressures and drivers, and developed and tested a roadmapping methodology to cope with the implementation of disruptive solutions. Leading-edge analysis and assessment methods and tools were developed, multiple technologies were tested, scientific and guidance publications were produced. All of this can be explored and absorbed into a coherent management process. This paper describes the TRUST approach for infrastructure AM, addressing strategic, tactical and operational planning, supported by professional-grade software. © 2016 IWA Publishing.

A decision support system (DSS) tool for the assessment of intervention\nstrategies (Alternatives) in an urban water system (UWS) with an\nintegral simulation model called `WaterMet(2)' is presented. The DSS\npermits the user to identify one or more optimal Alternatives over a\nfixed long-term planning horizon using performance metrics mapped to the\nTRUST sustainability criteria. The DSS exposes lists of in-built\nintervention options and system performance metrics for the user to\ncompose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the\nWaterMet(2) model, and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may\nbe specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS. A\nmulti-criteria decision analysis approach is employed within the DSS to\ncompare the defined Alternatives and to rank them with respect to a\npre-specified weighting scheme for different Scenarios. Two rich,\ninteractive graphical user interfaces, one desktop and one web-based,\nare employed to assist with guiding the end user through the stages of\ndefining the problem, evaluating and ranking Alternatives. This\nmechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare\ndifferent strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple\nScenarios. The efficacy of the DSS is demonstrated on a northern\nEuropean case study inspired by a real-life UWS for a mixture of\nquantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate how the\nDSS, integrated with an UWS modelling approach, can be used to assist\nplanners in meeting their long-term, strategic-level sustainability\nobjectives.

Visual Decision Support Tool for Supporting Asset Management Performance, Risk, and Cost Analysis
Report
2016
Bradley Jurkovac /  Helena Alegre /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Managing urban water infrastructures faces the challenge of jointly dealing with assets of diverse types, useful life, cost, ages and condition. Service quality and sustainability require sound long-term planning, well aligned with tactical and operational planning and management. In summary, the objective of an integrated approach to infrastructure asset management is to assist utilities answer the following questions: The AWARE-P approach ([www.aware-p.org][1]) offers a coherent methodological framework and a valuable portfolio of software tools. It is designed to assist water supply and wastewater utility decision-makers in their analyses and planning processes. It is based on a Plan-Do-Check-Act process and is in accordance with the key principles of the International Standards Organization (ISO) 55000 standards on asset management. It is compatible with, and complementary to WERF's SIMPLE framework. The software assists in strategic, tactical, and operational planning, through a non-intrusive, web-based, collaborative environment where objectives and metrics drive IAM planning. It is aimed at industry professionals and managers, as well as at the consultants and technical experts that support them. It is easy to use and maximizes the value of information from multiple existing data sources, both in data-rich and data-stressed environments. This project aimed at testing, validating, and tailoring the AWARE-P approach and software in the U.S. wastewater services context; developing new open-source software tools.

Methods to detect outliers in network flow measurements that may be due to pipe bursts or unusual consumptions are fundamental to improve water distribution system on-line operation and management, and to ensure reliable historical data for sustainable planning and design of these systems. To detect and classify anomalous events in flow data from district metering areas a four-step methodology was adopted, implemented and tested: i) data acquisition, ii) data validation and normalization, iii) anomalous observation detection, iv) anomalous event detection and characterization. This approach is based on the renewed concept of outlier regions and depends on a reduced number of configuration parameters: the number of past observations, the true positive rate and the false positive rate. Results indicate that this approach is flexible and applicable to the detection of different types of events (e.g., pipe burst, unusual consumption) and to different flow time series (e.g., instantaneous, minimum night flow).

iGPI, the National Initiative for Infrastructure Asset Management is a Portuguese collaborative project led by LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory, Portugal) through which 19 water utilities develop their own infrastructure asset management (IAM) systems and plans in a joint training and capacitation programme. Technical assistance to the participating utilities is ensured by LNEC, IST (Technical University of Lisbon) and Addition, a software development company. The water utilities get collective as well as one-on-one support and specific training. They benefit from networking with the other utilities in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The developed products, including training materials, templates and guidelines for developing strategic and tactical IAM plans, are available to the general public. This project has greatly contributed to the establishment of reference methodologies and standards for IAM planning, in a range of utilities of widely diverse size and context, effectively defining an accepted best practice. This paper discusses the project's format and its advantages, and goes on to describe the main outcomes, including selected cases and final products.

Data Mining techniques to predict sewer condition
Thesis

Guilherme Carvalho
Class imbalance, Classification, Random Forest, Wastewater pipes
The proper management of wastewater pipes is an important issue in today’s society, with serious financial and health implications. The ability to adequately prioritise maintenance inspections on these pipes may consequently significantly increase the quality of life of the affected populations. In this thesis, techniques to achieve this are studied. Using Data Mining procedures the goal is to be able to predict which pipes are more likely to be close to failure. The main prediction method used is the random forest, although other algorithms are also studied, in particular, conditional forests, logistic regression and Naive Bayes. To have a more global view of the problem, as well as to be able to obtain better predictions, variable selection techniques are also studied and applied, namely, mutual informa- tion and step-backwards search. Since it was found that (fortunately) only very rarely are pipes found to be in poor state, the examination of the problem extends to class balancing methodologies. Results show that there is no clear winning algorithm, although both ensembling and class balancing techniques manage to boost the performance of the tested algorithms. The results obtained are com- plemented by confidence measures to try to placate variability. Parallel to this investigation, a restriction of the problem to the pipes having a specific type of damage is conducted, and its results compared with the more general model.

The aim of this paper is to present the collaborative project iPERDAS, on water losses and energy efficiency management, and provide examples of the main results achieved by the participants during 2014. iPERDAS, led by LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory, Portugal), was a project through which 17 water utilities developed their own water-energy losses programmes, following a joint training and capacitation approach (www.iPERDAS.org). The group of participating water utilities was distributed across the country and supplies water to nearly 16% of the Portuguese population along 11633 km of pipes. The group was quite heterogeneous in terms of dimension, corporate structure and level of maturity in water losses management which enabled rich discussions and sharing of best practices. Utilities have received collective as well as one-on-one support, specific training, and benefited from networking with each other in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The most significant results of this project include the utilities’ Water and Energy Losses Management Plans, the establishment of solid procedures to carry out water and energy audits, the improvement of inter- departmental communication and the development of an integrated and sound organisational process for water-energy management.

Decision support system, Intervention strategy, Risk, Water metabolism model
A Decision Support System (DSS) tool for the assessment of intervention strategies (Alternatives) in an Urban Water System (UWS) with an integral simulation model called “WaterMet2” is presented. The DSS permits the user to identify one or more optimal Alternatives over a fixed long-term planning horizon using performance metrics mapped to the TRUST sustainability criteria (Alegre et al., 2012). The DSS exposes lists of in-built intervention options and system performance metrics for the user to compose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the WaterMet2 model and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may be specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach is employed within the DSS to compare the defined Alternatives and to rank them with respect to a pre-specified weighting scheme for different Scenarios. Two rich, interactive Graphical User Interfaces, one desktop and one web- based, are employed to assist with guiding the end user through the stages of defining the problem, evaluating and ranking Alternatives. This mechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare different strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple Scenarios. The efficacy of the DSS is demonstrated on a northern European case study inspired by a real-life urban water system for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate how the DSS, integrated with an UWS modelling approach, can be used to assist planners in meeting their long-term, strategic level sustainability objectives.

Final report with DSS methodology, software and case study from an idealized pilot city
Report
2015
Kourosh Behzadian /  Mark S. Morley /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Rita Ugarelli /  Zoran Kapelan
The report presents a detailed description of a Decision Support System (DSS) methodology and software tool for use as a decision support tool to assist in the management of Urban Water Systems (UWS). The report is divided into the following three principal sections: An initial description of the DSS methodology and modelling concept is followed by a definition of the DSS problem and the elements of the DSS decision matrix and, finally, the ranking of alternatives in the DSS. Specifically, this section describes the DSS structure which encapsulates a framework for the assessment of intervention strategies in an UWS. The internal structure of the DSS engine comprises three principle modules including Environment, Performance and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The ‘Environment’ module manages the specifications of the analysis including timing, intervention strategies, PIs, scenarios and customised model input. The ‘Performance’ module is responsible for evaluating the two categories of metrics: (1) quantitative performance metrics calculated by WaterMet2 and the Risk Assessment module; (2) qualitative metrics defined within the DSS and quantified by external tools or third-parties outside the immediate scope of the DSS. The MCDA module applies a user-configured ranking approach to the specified intervention strategies for the purposes of scoring and ranking them for each scenario and user preference combination. The principal stages of the DSS map to four steps including 1) problem definition, 2) population of decision matrix and calculation of metrics (or impact assessment), 3) ranking of alternatives and viewing detailed results and 4) viewing result modification and re-evaluation of intervention strategies. The second part describes the DSS software tool itself. Two complementary interface instances are presented for the DSS, representing Desktop and web-based tools. The overviews of both tools consist of an introduction to how input data are prepared, how to run a simulation and, finally, how to interpret results in different formats. The final part of this report illustrates the use of DSS applied to the case study problem. This describes the configuration of the DSS for the case study problem for a city which faces water scarcity problems over a 30-year planning horizon, starting from year 2015. Seven intervention strategies for ameliorating this issue are examined through both implementations of the DSS. Six performance metrics are considered including five quantitative measures and a single qualitative criterion. The analysis accommodates two rates of future population growth (i.e. low and high) can be envisaged as two individual scenarios for a 30 year planning period starting from 2010. Comparison of the intervention strategies with respect to these performance metrics is also conducted based on three weighting schemes representing differing stakeholder perspectives. These weighting schemes include equal weights, and the perspectives of the Water Company and Consumers. The DSS is able to rank and prioritise the proposed intervention strategies under different individual specified scenarios and weighting schemes and to ultimately combine them to produce a single ranking for each intervention strategy.

A key worldwide challenge in most sectors is to boost the effective adoption of innovation, as underpinned by the new European Union research programme Horizon 2020, which focuses on increasing innovation in Europe from 2014 to 2020. This is particularly relevant in the water sector, often perceived as conservative and averse to change. This paper discusses the role that collaborative knowledge-transfer projects can play in effectively rolling out R&D in the water industry. LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) has designed a structured model based on a phased programme and a network of utilities and researchers. The paper presents the core principles, the rationale, the model and methods used, and the theoretical background, as well as the project's impact, outcomes and products. The discussion highlights the lessons learnt and provides a formal analysis of the advantages of focusing on middle management as an effective entry point, even if innovation is needed across the organization. Making training materials, guidelines, use cases, data and software publicly available after the project's end has proven to have a decisive multiplying effect. The paper also argues in favour of the collaborative model as a basis for R&D sustainability, and details on-going and planned developments. © IWA Publishing 2015.

The present paper aims at providing reference values of consumption variables and daily consumption patterns for a variety of scenarios based on rigorous analysis work over 37 different urban and peri-urban DMA (District Metering Areas) in the northern and southern regions of Portugal. A comprehensive methodology that involves collecting, processing, characterizing and profiling demand, infrastructure, billing and socio-demographic data was adopted. This paper focuses on the results obtained on consumption data characterization step. Main results have shown that the analysed regions have distinct socio-demographic, infrastructure and billing make-ups that reveal differences in terms of water consumption trends. In the north region, families are bigger, consume less water per capita comparatively to the south and have a more regular consumption throughout the day. In the south region, population is more active and consume water essentially in the morning and night periods.

Smart meter, Supply systems operation, Use cases, Water utilities
Smart metering (SM) has the potential to improve distribution systems planning and operation and the overall system’s water-energy efficiency. Although numerous water utilities already explore SM systems, the main focus has been water loss management and control of large consumers’ consumption and most of the existing SM technologies are often used in isolation. Therefore, there is a need for a more integrated and complete approach that covers non-current applications of SM data on water and energy consumption. The work presented in this paper identified and validated a set of relevant applications derived from SM real-time data, that are valuable for the water utilities. Moreover, it is presented a method to test the ICT tool development that implements the applications.

The National Initiative for Infrastructure Asset Management (iGPI) led by LNEC, IST and Addition, and its twin initiative PGPI, led by AGS, were collaborative projects through which a total of 30 Portuguese water utilities developed IAM systems and plans through a collective training, capacitation and R&D rollout programme (Apr 2012 – Oct 2013). The utilities received specialized training, collective and individual support, and networked with the other utilities in a common process with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The products, including software, training materials, guidelines and templates for developing strategic and tactical IAM plans, are in the public domain. The projects have significantly contributed to the rollout of reference methodologies and standards for IAM planning, demonstrated in a range of utilities of varied size and context, successfully pushing a consensual best practice. The methodology and outcomes are discussed and illustrated with selected cases. Keywords:

Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Water utilities have exponentially increased the usage of software and data solutions in recent years, from daily operation to long-term planning and corporate management. The cumulative refinement of generic software approaches has led to major advances, but marginal improvements are shrinking, as the limiting factors imposed by legacy software paradigms take over. This poster describes a collaborative and pluggable software platform and project, hosting an open range of apps focused on specific reengineering of core water utility engineering processes. Software development is combined with a long-term R&D roll-out strategy, connecting with the industry and a network of public research organizations. With references to practical workflows in water utilities, the text illustrates the increased efficiency of this new software paradigm, resulting in measurable alignment of operational, tactical and strategic objectives, processes and users.

apparent losses, real losses, smart metering, water consumption, water losses
The control of water losses is a major concern in the sustainability of urban water utilities and in promoting the efficient use of this natural resource. Recent advances in telemetry technology provide high-resolution consumption data at the consumer level, allowing for a remarkable knowledge improvement on the different water balance components. However, few studies focus on systematic approaches for improving system operation and maintenance by processing and analysing large amounts of consumption data. This paper presents a new methodology to calculate real losses and apparent losses in distribution networks using data collected from telemetry systems. The methodology proposes a set of algorithms that are simple to implement. These algorithmswere tested on different districtmetered areas (DMA) to improve understanding about water loss components and have already been included in commercial software. The results showed that these algorithms are robust and allow for accurately estimating the background leakage level (and unreported leaks and bursts), detecting earlier the occurrence of bursts and providing important insights into the type of illegal water uses. The use of these approaches reduced non-revenue water by more than 10% in the majority of the DMA tested. These findings are promising and demonstrate the strong potential of telemetry systems to reduce water losses and to improve the understanding of water uses.

Helena Alegre /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Long term planning, asset valuation, capital investment strategy, urban water systems
Strategic asset management of urban water infrastructures jointly deals with assets of diverse nature, useful life, cost, age and condition. Service sustainability requires a sound long-term planning, which needs assessing, among other aspects: the value of the infrastructure over time; the need for reinvestments; the impact of long-term re-investment policies. The infrastructure value index (IVI) was proven to be a powerful modelling tool for combined long-term planning of linear and vertical assets. An open-source software enables IVI assessment for both asset-by-asset detailed inventory and for simplified cohort-based infrastructure description. This paper presents the formulation, discusses the underlying assumptions and applicability, and illustrates its use for strategic planning.

Condition prediction and deterioration forecasts are crucial for long-term planning of water and wastewater systems. Although sufficiently beneficial to inspire full coverage strategies, particularly in sewers, inspections are costly and it may be valuable to prioritize them based on correlations between previous results and potentially explanatory factors (e.g., age, material). The paper reports on a detailed application of a Random Forest classification algorithm in the context of a utility's thorough ongoing CCTV inspection program and AM planning, where it has been used both for estimating the importance of potential co-variates in predicting sewer condition and in directing investment in inspections.

Nowadays a variety of methodologies (e.g. black-box predictors, absolute minimums of night flows) are applied to extract relevant information for leakage control, network operation, and system planning and rehabilitation. However, the value of profiling the 24-hour demand cycle as a central element for statistical analysis, as well as a definition of normality and behavior, is often overlooked. A reliable set of methods and algorithms including data acquisition, validation and normalization procedures to obtain reliable 24-hour demand profiling is described, aided by an efficient software implementation, validated through the application in a large number of DMA from over 40 different utilities.

The failure prediction process plays an important role in the management of urban water systems infrastructures. An accurate description of the deterioration of urban drainage systems is necessary for optimal investment and rehabilitation planning. Predicting urban drainage system and sewer pipe failures is an important challenge since available failure data often have a short failure history and incomplete records. In the study presented in this thesis, five different failure prediction models, the non- homogeneous Poisson process, the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process, decision trees, the Weibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process (LEYP), were implemented and explored in order to identify models that combine good failure predic- tion results with robustness, when applied to different pipe samples. The five models were applied to a failure data set provided by The LEYP and the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process presented the overall best results throughout the models comparison, presenting accurate predictions and a good ability to detect pipes with high likelihood of failure. Decision trees only detected pipes with high likelihood of failure when considering a short- term predicting window and the accuracy of the predictions was one of the best when using robust decision trees. TheWeibull accelerated lifetime model was one of the best when considering a medium-term prediction window but failed to predict when considering a shorter one and the expected number of failures could only be obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, which can be a time-consuming procedure.

Comparative Study of Three Stochastic Models for Prediction of Pipe Failures in Water Supply Systems
Journal Article
Journal of Infrastructure Systems
2013
André Martins /  João P. Leitão /  Conceição Amado
The prediction of pipe failures in urban water systems is a complex process because the available failure records, originating in work orders, are often short and incomplete. To identify a robust and simple model with good failure prediction results using short data history, three existing models were compared in this study: the single-variate Poisson process, the Weibull accelerated lifetime model, and the linear-extended Yule process. This work also presents modifications to these models that enable them to produce more accurate predictions and overcome computational issues for practical software implementation. The three models, together with the improvements where applicable, were applied to water supply system data provided by a Portuguese water utility, and the results were comparatively analysed to assess the accuracy of each model. The Weibull accelerated lifetime model yielded the best results among the three models, accurately predicting failures and detecting pipes with high failure likelihood; however, it is based on Monte Carlo simulations, which can be time-consuming. The linear extended Yule process could also effectively detect pipes with higher failure likelihood; however, it presented a clear tendency to overestimate the number of future failures. The single-variate Poisson process is the simplest of the three models and produced failure prediction results of lower quality.

Water utilities have addressed the operation of sewer systems with a reactive approach, and lack of data on the condition of sewers hinders the development of predictive models. In this study, customer complaint/ failure databases were used to identify the various problems that are occurring within the sewer system. Two state of the art software tools were used for comparing different statistical models that use complaints/failure databases: Fail model and SIMA model. We found that in general, the NHPP model tends to overestimate failure probability when compared with the Poisson and LEYP models; and that such overestimation is higher for smaller grid cell (or sub-catchment) areas.

The AWARE-P IAM planning software offers a non-intrusive, web-based, collaborative integration environment for a wide variety of data and processes that may be relevant to the IAM decision-making process, including maps, GIS shapefiles and geodatabases; inventory records; work orders, maintenance, inspections/CCTV records; network models, performance indicators, asset valuation records, among others. The software provides an organized framework for evaluating and comparing planning alternatives or competing IAM solutions, through selected performance, risk and cost metrics. It comprises a portfolio of system metrics and network analysis tools that may also be used individually for diagnosis and sensitivity gain. The public beta release in early 2012 garnered significant numbers of users worldwide, and subsequent versions and a growing number of utility deployments and pilots have been steadily confirming the potential of its system-based approach. It is based on the collaborative, web-based and highly modular Baseform platform (www.baseform.org), which runs wherever Java is supported, and materializes as an integrated and expandable suite of plug-in tools, taking advantage of the platform's user management, common data integration services and next-generation 2D/3D visualization capabilities with Google Earth® integration among other features. The paper describes the software’s design and main features, and illustrates its main use cases.

iGPI, the National Initiative for Infrastructure Asset Management (April 2012 - October 2013), is a Portuguese collaborative project led by LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory, Portugal) through which 19 water utilities develop their own IAM systems and plans through a joint training and capacitation programme. Technical assistance to the participating utilities is ensured by LNEC, by a team from IST (Technical University of Lisbon) and by Addition, a software development company. The water utilities get collective as well as one-on-one support, specific training, and benefit from networking with the other utilities in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The developed products, including training materials, templates and guidelines for developing strategic and tactical IAM plans, are available to the general public. This project has greatly contributed to the establishment of reference methodologies and standards for IAM planning, demonstrated in a range of utilities of widely diverse size and context, effectively defining an accepted best practice. This paper discusses the project’s format and its advantages, and goes on to describe the main outcomes, including selected cases and final products.

Chlorine modelling, Decay kinetics, Drinking water quality, EPANET
The modelling of chlorine residual in water supply systems is of great importance in managing disinfectant concentrations throughout the network. First order decay kinetics are currently often used to describe both bulk and wall chlorine consumption. However, more complex approaches have been proposed, namely a parallel, two-reactant second order decay model (2R model) that has been reported as yielding better accuracy for simulating chlorine bulk decay in laboratory tests. The recent EPANET Multi-Species Extension (EPANET MSX) brought enhanced capabilities for the simulation of chlorine residuals in water supply systems, including the use of the 2R model or any other formulation. In the current paper, the performance of the 2R model as well as of first and nthorder decay kinetics was assessed for full scale modelling of chlorine in a transmission system. Results have shown that a similar level of accuracy can be achieved with the three tested kinetic models, provided that a good calibration of the wall decay coefficient is accomplished. Although with improved modelling capabilities, the use of the standalone EPANET MSX was less user-friendly than normal EPANET application by the lack of a graphical interface allowing for the visualization of chlorine concentration profiles along the system. The use of the 3D-enabled Epanet Java web application circumvented such limitations. This tool together with a better characterization and estimation of the bulk and wall decay components allow for a more practical and accurate modelling of chlorine in water supply systems, while taking advantage of EPANET MSX's enhanced capabilities. © 2013 The Authors.

The aim of this paper is to compare sorting and ranking methods for prioritization of rehabilitation interventions of sewers, taking into account risk, performance and cost. For that purpose multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) methods such as ELECTRE TRI for sorting and ELECTRE III for ranking are applied in a real case-study and the results obtained are compared. The case study is a small sanitary sewer system from a Portuguese utility located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The problem to investigate is the prioritization of the sewer candidates for rehabilitation. The decision maker (a panel group of specialists) has chosen five assessment measures: water level and maximum flow velocity (hydraulic performance indices), sewer importance and failure repair cost (collapse-related consequences of failure) and the risk of collapse. The results show that the outcomes from ELECTRE III are easier to understand than those from ELECTRE TRI method. Two different sets of weights were used, and the sorting and ranking results from both methods were found to be sensitive to them. ELECTRE TRI method is not straightforward as it involves technical parameters that are difficult to define, such as reference profiles and cut levels.

A new approach to estimating household night consumption at DMA level

DMA, household night consumption, telemetry, water losses
The most widely used method for assessing real water losses in a district metering area (DMA) involves measuring minimum night flow and estimating what fraction of it is not ascribed to real losses. It may be further broken down into authorized household consumption, authorized non-household consumption and non-authorised uses. Household consumption is in general the most relevant and harder to estimate component. It is very much context-dependent and very few studies are published outside of the UK. This paper summarises the results achieved in a recent study carried out in two Portuguese municipalities, and describes a set of simplified rules developed to predict DMA night household consumption. These rules depend on the number of households and on their social-demographic and billing features. Once household night consumption is estimated, it can then be deducted from to minimum nigh flow monitored in a DMA or part of a DMA, contributing to a more accurate estimate of real water losses. The results obtained show significant differences from case to case, but in most cases lower values than the published UK references. This is believed to show that residential night consumption is rather context-dependent and that real losses may in fact be higher than estimated so far in this region.

Asset management, Rehabilitation planning, Urban water infrastructure
Water services are a strategic sector of large social and economic relevance. It is therefore essential that they are managed rationally and efficiently. Advanced water supply and wastewater infrastructure asset management (lAM) is key in achieving adequate levels of service in the future, particularly with regard to reliable and high quality drinking water supply, prevention of urban flooding, efficient use of natural resources and prevention of pollution. This paper presents a methodology for supporting the development of urban water lAM, developed during the AWARE-P project as well as an appraisal of its implementation in four water utilities. Both water supply and wastewater systems were considered. Due to the different contexts and features of the utilities, the main concerns vary from case to case; some problems essentially are related to performance, others to risk. Cost is a common deciding factor. The paper describes the procedure applied, focusing on the diversity of drivers, constraints, benefits and outcomes. It also points out the main challenges and the results obtained through the implementation of a structured procedure for supporting urban water lAM.

Cost, Multiple criteria decision  aiding, Performance, Rehabilitation, Risk, Urban water systems
The current paper briefly presents the infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology developed in the framework of the AWARE-P project for the comparison of alternative rehabilitation solutions and applies it to a Portuguese water supply system taking into consideration different criteria. These criteria incorporate three assessment dimensions – performance, cost and risk – expressed by several assessment measures (e.g., investment cost, risks of pipe leakage, risk of pipe burst and infrastructure index value). Criteria are aggregated by a Multiple Criteria Decision-Aid (MCDA) technique – the ELECTRE III method. Alternative rehabilitation solutions were established and assessed using this approach. Results are presented and discussed.

Failure prediction, Infrastructure asset management, LEYP, Poisson process, Water supply networks, Weibull regression
The failure prediction process plays an important role in infrastructure asset management of urban water systems. This process aims at assessing the future behaviour of a urban water network. However, failure prediction in urban water systems is a complex process, since the available failure data often present a short failure history and incomplete records. In the study presented in this thesis, three di erent failure prediction models, the single- variate Poisson process, theWeibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process, were implemented and explored in order to identify robust and simple models that combine good failure prediction results using short data history. The three models were applied to a Portuguese urban water supply system. TheWeibull accelerated lifetime model presented the best results throughout the comparison of the three models, presenting accurate predictions and a good ability to detect pipes with high likelihood of failure. Nevertheless, the expected number of failures can only be obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, which can be a time-consuming procedure. The linear extended Yule process could also e ectively detect pipes more prone to fail. However, it presented a clear tendency to overestimate the number of future failures. The single-variate Poisson process is a very simple stochastic process, that is easy to un- derstand and to apply. Due to its simplicity, this prediction process lacks the ability of di erentiating e ectively the water network pipes, which leads to lower quality individual failure predictions. It is noteworthy that no signi cant di erence between the three models results was found when predicting failures in pipes with no failure history.

planning, rehabilitation, strategies, urban water infrastructure
Urban water systems are essential to modern societies; managing them strategically is a challenge, as they require continuous and costly capital maintenance to ensure service sustainability. Wise rehabilitation and maintenance planning are therefore essential. This paper presents an application of an innovative urban water infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology, developed by project AWARE-P, to the case of the Oeiras & Amadora water utility (SMAS O&A). This IAM approach considers three levels of planning: strategic, tactical and operational, corresponding to long-, medium- and short-term horizons. One of the main advances of the approach is efficiently integrating assessment dimensions other than cost, namely performance and risk. The entire utility was considered at the strategic level and at the first stage of the tactical level. A district metering area of the water supply system was used as a pilot for testing the procedure at the more detailed level of tactical planning. Five IAM alternatives were devised, including a conventional like-for-like pipe replacement alternative and a number of optimal design alternatives that take into account energy efficiency and system resilience. After assessment and comparison, the alternative that represented the best trade-off was selected using a simple multi-criteria decision method. The application of the AWARE-P approach by SMAS O&A contributed to a shift of paradigm within the organisation with regard to rehabilitation and maintenance planning.

The AWARE-P project aims to promote the application of integrated and risk-based approaches to the rehabilitation of urban water supply and wastewater drainage systems. Central to the project is the development of a software platform based on a set of computational components, which assist in the analyses and decision support involved in the planning process for sustainable infrastructural asset management. The AWARE-P software system brings together onto a common platform the infrastructural geo- referenced data that describe the physical water supply or sewerage systems, as well as a variety of data originating in the several information systems that exist in the water utility corporate environment, such as maintenance and work orders data, billing and costs databases, or network analysis models. Building on those, it makes available an organized set of user- configurable assessment algorithms related to performance, cost and risk, which are used to evaluate alternative system configurations or planning solutions, against current and projected or hypothetical scenarios.

infrastructure asset management, planning, rehabilitation, water supply
This paper presents the integrated methodology for infrastructure asset management (IAM) developed in AWARE-P, an R&D project aimed at producing adequate and effective support tools for assisting urban water utilities in decision making and rehabilitation planning (www.aware-p.org). The proposed methodology is organized into three planning and decisional levels (strategic, tactical and operational); at each level, a cycle based on PDCA (plan-do-check-act) principles runs through (i) definition of objectives and targets; (ii) diagnosis; (iii) plan development; (iv) plan implementation; and (v) plan monitoring and review. The methodology assesses the system and any planning solutions under consideration along three dimensions – cost, risk and performance – with a variety of standardised assessment methods and models proposed for each. Despite being based on IAM principles generally recommended and adopted by leading-edge research, consultant and utility organizations, the proposed methodology differs from existing approaches in the incorporation, in a single organised framework, of the entire IAM process with an integrated vision of the water networks – i.e., looking at the infrastructure as a system, and not as a mere sum of individual assets – in the long-term. Specific methods and software tools have been developed to assist water utilities in implementing the AWARE-P approach in the industry environment, and several business cases are available.

Use and Collection of data in Gemini V A in Asset Management
Thesis
2010
Kjersti Holte
As the water and wastewater network in Europe is declining, the recommendation is to move towards Asset Management, as this is a proactive approach to system rehabilitation. This thesis has been written at LNEC, Portugal, in cooperation with the AWARE-P team, who is developing a software to deal with future planning of rehabilitation of the network. The work has been to collect the need of data in their modules, looking at data collected from other rehabilitation softwares and comparing it to what is available in Gemini VA to value the use of Gemini VA for rehabilitation planning support. Planning tools for rehabilitation of water and wastewater networks is still in the developing phase. The programs are often data hungry, and collecting data is time demanding. Gemini VA represent a good software for collecting base data used in rehabilitation planning, and is the most used water and wastewater maintenance software in Norway. It's important to identify the limits and possibilities of the software for future development, and the goal of this thesis has been to look into improvements of the software to give better data at a lower time cost. In the Asset Management approach the condition of the network must first be decided. This analysis can be done with basic data such as material, construction year, dimension and condition factor from surveys done on the network (CCTV etc). When the condition is determined, assessments within cost, performance and risk can be completed at the strategic, tactical and operational level. Gemini VA can provide a lot of base data, but even though the data is available, the preparations is time demanding, and the only data validation feature available, is a material-dimension-construction year- validation. Therefore historical data, and the rest of the structural data, must be validated manually. Gemini VA should try to move towards an Asset Managment approach by including more validation reports, pre made statistical reports, and visualisation effects of the statistics. The software should also include cost, more information on stormwater assets, water quality tests and more pumpingstation and treatment plant information. Gemini VA can be used to collect data for a national statistical database for utilities with low or poor record of historical data to retrieve statistical numbers for planning (failure rate for different materials, etc).

Is strategic asset management applicable to small and medium utilities?
Journal Article
Water Science and Technology

Helena Alegre
Urban water infrastructures provide essential services to modern societies and represent a major portion of the value of municipal physical assets. Managing these assets rationally is therefore fundamental for the sustainability of the services and to the economy of societies. “Asset Management” (AM) is a modern term for an old practice—assets have always been managed. In recent years, significant evolution occurred in terms of the AM formal approaches, of the monitoring and decision support tools and of the implementation success cases. However, most tools developed are too sophisticated and data seek for small utilities. The European R&amp;D network COST Action C18 ( www.costc18.org) identified key research problems related to the management of urban water infrastructures, currently not covered by on-going projects of the European Framework Program. The top 1 topic is “Efficient management of small community”. This paper addresses challenges and opportunities for small and medium utilities with regard to infrastructure AM (IAM). To put this into context, the first sections discuss the need for IAM, highlight key recent developments, and present IAM drivers, as well as research and development gaps, priorities and products needed.

Estimation of household consumption is one of the key elements in the analysis of water losses in distribution networks. Household night consumption is very specific of each network and socio-demographic context, and can vary according to multiple factors. This paper describes an on-going study aimed at assisting a Portuguese water utility in the development and implementation of a methodology to quantify household night consumption based on expedite rules, dependent on socio-demographic and billing factors. A stochastic model was developed to simulate household night consumption and was tested in 8 study areas. The paper describes the selection of case studies, the collection and processing of field data, the establishment of significant night consumption metering periods based on cluster analysis, the identification and characterization of rectangular pulse events, and the process of identification of and correlation with possible explanatory factors.

A large number of distribution network pipes in Portugal is over-sized for human demand flows, due to regulatory fire-fighting minimum diameters, which has a direct bearing on water quality, given the potentially lowvelocities it may originate. In order to assess the magnitude of the problem, a large scale studywas undertaken, based on twenty water distribution system sectors, from networks across the country, representative of a wide range of conditions. Calibrated hydraulic models developed and updated by the utilities were provided. The extended period models were used for exhaustive runs of typical operational conditions, and the results - flow velocity, pressure, head loss and Reynolds number - were recorded for the sets of time periods concerned. The resultswere analyzed by using a computer application specifically developed for this purpose.Acomplete set of statistics for the above parameters was produced. Performance assessment of water distribution systems was also performed based on the results obtained. The main conclusions were that (i) the networks are over-designed with very low velocities in most of the time (due to being designed for the peak flow conditions in 40-year time and for fire-fighting conditions) and (ii) the systems are operated with pressures higher than necessary with evident potential of water losses and energy saving.

Sustainable implementation of network analysis decision-making tools in the operational environment

Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Dália Loureiro
Water distribution models, data-intensive tools, decision-making, implementation
Water distribution network analysis models are the single most influential tool in understanding existing or projected networks, and a precious aid in the assessment of evolution scenarios. As such, they are at the core of the decision-making process in any short-, medium-, or long-term asset management strategy. However, they are still less than well-established in many parts of the world, particularly in the operational and technical management environments. Experience shows that it is only possible to fully realise the potential of network models in a water utility when there is an internal structure explicitly devoted to the tasks of building, managing and updating them in a sustainable and efficient manner. Externally developed models, where often not enough attention is paid to capability building and organisational issues, have a much greater chance of being abandoned by the utility, and after relatively short life spans. Conversely, the assimilation of model-building knowledge by the utility and the establishment of specific, tried-and-tested internal procedures have shown to be a successful formula that spurs a number of parallel innovative advancements in related areas within the utility. The internal development of simulation models is a powerful strategic driver for the process of information integration across the various information systems (IS) in the utility – GIS, customer/billing system, SCADA system, maintenance IS, laboratory IS (LIMS), etc. Water utilities are massive data generators; such data is, in turn, a precious asset to the organization. Water network models are a prime example of an engineering-oriented application that is very demanding on the quantity, scope and quality of the data it deploys, particularly if correctly and sustainably developed. It so happens that such information is at the very core of the engineering decision-making process, and beyond. The information requirements involved in the well-supported establishment of a network model place demanding questions to the other systems – particularly the GIS, SCADA and billing IS – that inevitably prompt an increase in quality and depth. It makes sense, therefore, that the development of network modelling within a water utility is approached in a structured and systematic way, in order to ensure the highest possible benefit in terms of the effort and resources invested – both in the generation of the initial solutions and in their maintenance and expansion throughout their lifespan (Figure 2 shows a recommended phased strategy for model development). The National Initiative for the Development of Simulation Models (INSSAA), a program ran in Portugal between 2003 and 2006 with the objective of promoting the development and use of simulation models by the utilities, explicitly in the operational and technical management tasks, is thought to be a valuable example of the above principles. Based on phased development, training and knowledge-building strategies, common to the set of 9 participating utilities, the following main components were covered: -Human resources – modelling team set-up, mission definition and organisational fit; training in network analysis model development, use and maintenance. -Planning, development, and commissioning by the utility teams of fully functional, calibrated models of network sectors, with a strategy for full territorial coverage. -Set-up of data and organisational mechanisms and procedures for the integration of the developed tool, its efficient management and its integration with the other IS across the utility. This paper presents the INSSAA program and its stages of implementation, and focuses on the results obtained, including the core gains; the main data, human and organisational difficulties and hurdles; and the ways found to overcome them. A discussion is undertaken on the global issues involved in the efficient creation and maintenance of engineering-oriented data-intensive tools, for the operational and technical management environments of water supply utilities.

Statistical analysis of recorded failure data in buried water distribution system pipes
Conference Proceedings

2007
Paulo Praça /  Ilídia Pinheiro /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
GIS application, Water distribution, pipe failure, statistical analysis
Water distribution pipe failure records are a primary source of information regarding the state of conservation of the buried infrastructure and the way it is operated. Failure can be defined as an event that requires an intervention to recover pipeline and system function. Such events are normally caused by break or collapse of pipes, and through leaks in unions. The functional effect of the physical damage is reflected in water supply interruptions that can last from a few hours to days, as well as pressure fluctuations, and flow availability and water quality changes at the consumers’ tap. Knowledge on the weakness of the network – the areas, materials or pipe types with the greatest numbers of occurrences, and the probable causes behind them, is a critical type of information for the network manager, who can act in anticipation to try and eliminate or reduce the failures, the associated costs and the drop in the levels of service at the consumers’. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a systematic process of information collection on failures in distribution systems, and to the development of tools for the prediction of failure events, based on the corresponding database of historical failures. Two examples of the latter are made available by the proprietary Care-W procedure and software (http://care-w.unife.it/), particularly through a PhM and a Poisson-based tools used to predict failure rates for classes of explanatory variables chosen by the user in a water distribution system. The methods proposed here were developed without the need for sophisticated or expensive software, and are made available based on simple MS® Excel® spreadsheets. Pipe failure records are grouped into explanatory classes of variables, and data is tested for fit to the statistical distribution used (Poisson); statistical indicators are used to evaluate if the classes have been well selected. With the failure rate for each class, and assuming a given Poisson distribution for the failures, it is possible to calculate the failure probability of each individual pipe. A GIS system (ESRI® ArcGIS 9.1®) is used in order to geographically illustrate failure rates and probabilities (Figure 1). Given those, a tool was developed for assessing the functional consequence of failure of each pipe in the network, in terms of pressure and affected demand, using a network model to evaluate each scenario. This tool was developed using ESRI® ArcObjects® and the Epanet simulator library of functions, and is fully integrated in the GIS system. Running the two mechanisms in conjunction, a quantitative measure of the risk of failure for each pipe (risk=probability of failure x consequence) can be mapped out (Figure 2). This methodology has been tested and used on the distribution system of Lisbon region municipality, with full integration of the data and results on the GIS system. It is found that the insight into the functional effect of the failures, together with the careful exploration of failure rates and probabilities, affords better supported decision-making in both operational and investment terms.

erformance assessment, rehabilitation, urban sewer systems
Urban sewer systems constitute a significant patrimony in Europe and worldwide. The structural quality and functional efficiency of sewer systems are fundamental to guarantee their good performance. These systems are nowadays facing problems of ageing, malfunctioning and overloading caused by deterioration due to long life times, improper maintenance, population growth or catchment increase. In order to effectively plan the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of sewer systems it is important to provide methods and tools for wastewater utilities in order to support the technical management of their systems. The importance of performance evaluation has been growing in most services and economic activities in recent years. Decisions must be economically and environmentally sustainable, the customer/consumer must be satisfied by the product or service provided, and legislation becomes ever more stringent and far-reaching. It is increasingly vital for the managers of an organization to know where, how and when changes must be introduced in order to reach a better performance. These decisions must be taken based on all the available relevant information. The objective of the methodology proposed in this paper is to establish, at the engineering level, the use of a performance assessment methodology suitable for the diagnosis, control and selection of solutions for the improvement of technical processes and systems performance. It can be applied to monitoring data or modelling results, in this case both to extended period operational scenarios and to a range of load factors, displaying appropriate dispersion bands (e.g. percentiles). The methodology is objective-oriented, quantitative and constitutes a standardised approach to technical performance assessment of sewerage systems as a useful contribution to the quest for a common language that would facilitate comparisons, prioritization and the setting of service standards. It is based on relevant performance variables or indicators, meaning the quantity which translates the system behaviour or properties from the point of view taken into consideration (e.g. hydraulic or environmental). It can be applied at catchment or system element level, depending on type of available data; performance functions scores the values of the performance variables or indicators against a scale of performance; for the element level assessment a generalising function is defined for extending the element-level calculation across the system, producing zonal or system-wide diagnoses. Through this methodology an overall view of system performance can be achieved facilitating performance comparisons. A case study is presented to illustrate the application.

exfiltration, infiltration, performance indicators, rehabilitation, sewer systems
The structural quality and functional efficiency of sewer systems are key parameters to guarantee the transfer of domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to treatment plants without infiltration nor exfiltration. Infiltration of groundwater is particularly detrimental to treatment plant efficiency, while exfiltration of wastewater can lead to groundwater contamination. The APUSS project associating universities, SMEs and municipalities in 7 European countries, developed new methods and techniques to assess and quantify infiltration and exfiltration (I/E) in sewer systems. This paper describes the establishment of a set of performance indicators (PI) developed to assess the impact of I/E on sewer systems and their application to three project case studies, in Italy and France, focusing on sewer systems characteristics, I/E measurements campaigns and PI application results. The methodology for PI definition consists in the selection and development of a sewer network property or state variable, which is expressive of aspects being scrutinized (I/E); the PI values are then calculated; finally, a classification of the PI values is made in relation to good or bad performance. The use of PI allows a standardized and objective comparison of the performance of sewer systems and constitutes a means to technically support the establishment of priorities for rehabilitation and/or construction investments taking into account I/E impacts.

leakage, pressure control, valve management, water distribution systems, water losses
A model to support decision systems regarding the quantification, location and opening adjustment of control valves in a network system, with the main objective to minimise pressures and consequently leakage levels is developed. This research work aims at a solution that allows simultaneously optimising the number of valves and its location, as well as valves opening adjustments for simulation in an extended period, dependently of the system characteristics. EPANET model is used for hydraulic network analysis and two operational models are developed based on the Genetic Algorithm optimisation method for pressure control, and consequently leakage reduction, since a leak is a pressure dependent function. In these two modules, this method has guaranteed an adequate technique performance, which demands a global evaluation of the system for different scenarios. A case study is presented to show the efficiency of the system by pressure control through valves management.

Water consumption, demand analysis, demand patterns, explanatory factors
Understanding the factors that influence daily and weekly water consumption patterns in distribution systems is fundamental for both long term tasks, such as planning, design, expansion or rehabilitation of the systems, and short term tasks, such as routine system operation or emergency management. This paper describes the development of a Portuguese nationwide program for characterizing residential water consumption, through the use of a specific consumption data analysis protocol and the build-up of a database of demand patterns; and for associating it with a range of easily obtained, potential relatable factors that include the technical features of the network (e.g., service pressure, network state and maintenance level, use of household tanks), billing and customer statistics and a range of social-demographic variables, such as age, social-economic level and mobility of consumers, age and type of buildings, and economic activities. The program is currently being test-run on a set of 20 metering districts from 9 water utilities, comprising a variety of network types and demand characteristics across representative urban areas of Portugal. The metering districts range in size from 2,000 to 12,000 connected properties, and have mostly been monitored since 2005 (in some cases, 2004). Total consumption is continuously monitored during the main seasonal scenarios (typically winter and summer) in the areas selected. Standardized daily demand patterns and consumption statistics are produced for each day of the week, as well as for each season, in case there is seasonality in the area. Social-demographic information is based on statistics obtained from the 2001 National Census for the basic statistical units, which are around 300 dwellings in size. After the initial run, the program is to be disseminated and made accessible to all water utilities willing to participate, on a voluntary basis and with data anonymity. This will be done mostly through a dedicated website containing the consumption database, together with query and analysis tools, as well as a supervised mechanism to submit new cases in standard format. It is believed that the publication of the result database and its continued growth will provide the water industry designers, consultants and managers with much more reliable and updated data on water consumption than previously available. It will also represent a means to estimate demand through correlation and profiling, in cases when there are no records to work from. The paper discusses the demand analysis performed, as well as the development of the set of potential explanatory factors (technical features of the network and social-demographic variables), and illustrates with the results obtained so far.

Performance assessment in urban water infrastructures is an increasingly important field of knowledge. Performance has traditionally been expressed in a variety of ways relating mostly to local design practice, with hardly any consensus on how it should be measured or compared. The efficient technical management of these systems deserves a specific approach, suited to the methodologies regularly employed while planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the systems. At the engineering level, decisions are based on operational, physical, and resources data and on analyses deploying simulation models, geographic information systems, or other information systems. However, such tools tend to produce vast amounts of insufficiently aggregated or performance-oriented information. This paper presents a performance assessment system that is based on the decisional concept of utility functions and designed as a technical analysis tool with the purpose of shifting the focus of technical management of urban drainage systems to a performance-oriented view.

exfiltration, infiltration, performance indicators, rehabilitation, sewer systems
The structural quality and functional efficiency of sewer systems are key parameters to guarantee the transfer of domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to treatment plants without infiltration nor exfiltration. Infiltration of groundwater is particularly detrimental to treatment plant efficiency, while exfiltration of wastewater can lead to groundwater contamination. The APUSS project associating universities, SMEs and municipalities in 7 European countries, developed new methods and techniques to assess and quantify infiltration and exfiltration (I/E) in sewer systems. This paper describes the establishment of a set of performance indicators (PI) developed to assess the impact of I/E on sewer systems and their application to three project case studies, in Italy and France, focusing on sewer systems characteristics, I/E measurements campaigns and PI application results. The methodology for PI definition consists in the selection and development of a sewer network property or state variable, which is expressive of aspects being scrutinized (I/E); the PI values are then calculated; finally, a classification of the PI values is made in relation to good or bad performance. The use of PI allows a standardized and objective comparison of the performance of sewer systems and constitutes a means to technically support the establishment of priorities for rehabilitation and/or construction investments taking into account I/E impacts.

Accounting for the influence of initial chlorine concentration, TOC, iron and temperature when modelling chlorine decay in water supply
Journal Article
Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology - Aqua
2004
Paula Vieira /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Dália Loureiro
Degradation of water quality in supply and distribution systems is one of the foremost problems that water companies are faced with. It is everyday practice in many countries to maintain a residual quantity of a disinfectant such as chlorine throughout the system, in order to ensure the safety of distributed water. However, the chlorine added at the water treatment plant disappears as it travels to the consumer tap, due to reactions in the bulk of the flow and at the pipe walls. This paper analyses the influence on free chlorine bulk decay of several water quality parameters, such as temperature, initial chlorine dosage, organic matter and iron content. The performance of five alternative kinetic models for describing the disinfectant behaviour is also assessed, considering both static and steady-state flow conditions. For the conditions tested, a parallel pseudo-first order model provided the best results.Although, in practice, parallel first order kinetic models fit experimental data better than the classic first order model, most water quality modelling software still relies on the latter as a base choice. The paper discusses practical conditions that may influence model selection for network simulation purposes, and the relevance of the associated errors.

Performance assessment, Performance indicators, Wastewater systems, Water supply systems
This paper addresses the issue of performance assessment in water and wastewater systems by reviewing two of the tools that are available to the companies operating in this field: systems of performance indicators and technical performance assessment through simulation. The paper focuses on a technical performance evaluation framework and its application to wastewater systems. The assessment is carried out through the application of utility functions to the network’s elements, and the production of performance- oriented graphs that yield concise and informative views about the system’s behaviour. Two case studies involving a combined sewer system and a separate domestic system are presented in order to illustrate the method.

Controlling water quality in intermittent supply systems
Journal Article
Water Science & Technology: Water Supply
2003
Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Sam James /  Nawal Sunna /  Atef Abu-Jaish /  Jean Chatila
In countries suffering from chronic water shortages, water distribution systems are often operated on an intermittent basis, leaving them unpressurised and allowing ingress of contaminated groundwater, particularly in areas lacking sewerage systems. The periods of stagnation can promote microbial regrowth, further compromising water quality. On the other hand, peaks in pressure and velocity in the pipe network lead to biofilm detachment events, thus releasing microbial cells that may escape the regular quality monitoring procedures and thus increase risk for the consumer. Finally, intermittent supply requires consumers to store water in household storage tanks, which often encourage bacterial regrowth. This paper reports on research undertaken in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, the UK and Portugal, which provided an improved understanding of the factors controlling bacterial concentrations in intermittent supplies, and presents an overview of the most important aspects of water quality control in intermittently operated networks.

Dependency of bulk chlorine decay rates on flow velocity in water distribution networks
Journal Article
Water Science & Technology: Water Supply
2003
José Menaia /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Adelaide Lopes /  Ema Fonte /  João Palma
Bulk decay rates, Chlorine modelling, Chlorine residual decay, Water distribution
Understanding chlorine residual decay kinetics and the factors that influence them are essential for such current tasks as siting chlorination facilities, dosage optimisation, choice of sampling locations and frequencies, and general design and operational control of drinking water networks, increasingly accomplished with the help of simulation models. Available constants for bulk chlorine decay are typically determined under static conditions. However, as for all fast reactions in water flows, chlorine consumption rates in drinking water pipes may be influenced by the existing mixing regimes, a function of flow turbulence, which is primarily controlled by flow velocity and pipe diameter. Flow velocities vary greatly in space and time in water transmission and distribution systems; pipe diameters are seldom uniform. Although both variables are readily available in the currently available network analysis simulators that implement chlorine models, such variations are not accounted for. Instead, a single preset decay rate constant is generally used for describing chlorine residual consumption throughout an entire system. In addition to highlighting the negligibleness of PVC pipe wall chlorine consumption, as such, this paper presents experimental evidence of a significant correlation between pipe flow velocity and bulk chlorine decay rates, and proposes a simple but effective approach to implement this dependency in current simulators.

Luiz de Souza Araújo /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Helena Ramos
The research described in this paper explores the suitability of a method for estimating the leakage-associated parameters and reaching a more plausible demand description than that afforded by traditional static estimates, when modelling the hydraulic behaviour of a water distribution system. Leakage is represented as a uniformly distributed, pressure-dependent demand and is deducted from the metered total system demand. The method relies on a genetic algorithm as the optimisation technique and uses de Epanet 2.0 programmable toolkit in order to create a general-purpose network analysis program.

Luiz de Souza Araújo /  Helena Ramos /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
The authors developed a model with the capacity to support decisions regarding the quantification, localisation and opening adjustment of valves in a network system, with the objective to minimise pressures and consequently water losses. Two operational modules are establlished: (1) for the evaluation of an objective-function to optimise the localisation of valves in the network system; (2) for the opening valve adjustment in order to optimise pressures through the evaluation of an aptitude function. New values of these parameters are generated randomly by using the technique of genetic algorithms; in order the system reaches its optimum value in terms of pressure minimisation (i.e., consequently leaks are minimised), and EPA’s programmable EPANET routines as general-purpose for network.

The use of performance indicators to support water network rehabilitation planning

performance indicators, rehabilitation, water supply systems
Most European water supply stakeholders have seen a good number of their existing water mains reach their expected lifetime, and high capital investments are required to renovate them. Rehabilitation is nowadays an imperative topic in the water industry agenda. Well-devised methodologies for rehabilitation planning are needed, in order to define where, when and how to rehabilitate water transmission and distribution networks. In principle, asset condition should be directly taken into consideration. However, that is a challenging task because mains are buried infrastructures, not easily inspected. Indirect measures such as performance indicators (PI) must be considered. The use of PI to monitor the evolution of mains behaviour and assist in the decision-making process is seen as one of the tools with greatest potential in this framework. This paper focuses on the work developed with regard to the selection and use of rehabilitation PI, in the scope of research project CARE-W: Computed Aided REhabilitation of Water networks.

Practical conditions for the use of a first order chlorine decay model in water supply

Paula Vieira /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
The maintenance of a residual quantity of a disinfectant such as chlorine throughout the system, in order to ensure the safety of distributed water is current practice in many countries. Chlorine added at the water treatment plant decays as it travels to the consumer tap, due to reactions in the bulk of the flow and at pipe walls. The classic kinetic model used to describe chlorine bulk reactions in most water quality modelling software packages is a first order decay model. In practice, other models provide considerably better fits in laboratory decay tests. Therefore, when the first order model is preferred to other models for simulation purposes, it is important to evaluate the magnitude of the associated errors. This paper discusses practical conditions for the application of first order/parallel first order models, based on the study of the influence of several water quality parameters (temperature, initial chlorine dosage, organic matter and iron content) on chlorine decay. Laboratory decay tests were carried out using groundwater and the performance of five kinetic models for describing bulk decay has also been assessed.

The effect of transient flow on chlorine decay in water supply systems

Dália Loureiro /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  José Menaia /  Helena Ramos /  Adelaide Lopes
The study and modelling of chlorine decay in distribution systems has been the subject of intense research in the last decade. This paper reports on a series of experiments carried out on a lifescale test rig in order to quantify any possible effect of hydraulic transients on residual chlorine concentrations in drinking water, comparatively to the decay in steady-state flow conditions. The results relate to two types of tests: steady-state tests were run in order to investigate the decay of residual chlorine during steady-state flow, for varying values of the Reynolds number; transient tests comprised an initial steady-state period, followed by successive transient events and a new steady-state period. The transient events were induced by rapid valve closing manoeuvres. The series of results obtained provide evidence towards the existence of a slowing down effect of hydraulic transients on chlorine decay rates, for the conditions represented by the experiment.

The assessment of performance in public utilities infrastructure is an important, yet still embryonic field of knowledge, especially as regards urban sewer systems. Performance has traditionally been expressed in terms that relate to local design practices. This has resulted in a variety of ways of assessing performance in different countries without a consensus on how it should be expressed. While performance indicators are a suitable tool for addressing the utility s performance in all its sectors of activity, the efficient technical management of the systems deserves a specific approach, better suited to the type of methodologies regularly employed while planning, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and rehabilitating the systems. At this engineering level, decisions are made based on operational, physical and natural resources data, and on the results of analyses deploying common engineering tools such as simulation models and information systems. However, such tools tend themselves to produce vast amounts of insufficiently aggregated information, which is scarcely performance-oriented. This paper presents the application of a performance assessment system, designed as a technical analysis tool, in order to shift the focus of technical management of urban drainage systems to a wider, more rigorous, performance-oriented view. The system draws from the experience gathered in performance assessment in water supply, and is based on the decisional concept of utility (performance) functions, in order to accommodate individual sensitivities and interpretations. The system is implemented as a post-processor to sewer modelling, showing significant potential in the performance evaluation of sewer systems, and provides a decision support basis for sewer system design, diagnosis, operation and rehabilitation. A comparative study involving several subsystems of the Estoril Coast interceptor system (Portugal) is presented in order to illustrate the method.

Rigorous application of the method to different performance fields of water networks, illustrated by various case studies. Detailed analysis of key areas of water networks' behaviour, including advances in the analysis and modelling procedures that are currently available, e.g. in water quality modelling and reliability analysis. Applicable to a range of engineering problems in water distribution. Performance analysis is becoming a key issue in the engineering approach to the control of water supply and distribution systems, both as a natural process of evolution of the modelling and design methods available, and as a consequence of an ever increasing awareness of the quality of the service provided within the water industry today. This book presents a systematic approach to the analysis of technical performance of water networks by creating a framework in which a variety of concepts and criteria can be included. The system presented provides a shift in the way engineering problems are formulated in water supply, allowing greater control of analysis objectives and improved sensitivity.

Over the past twenty years a major financial effort has been made to improve the water supply in Portugal. A significant evolution can be observed, with 77% of the population currently connected to public systems and a target of 95% by the year 2000. Supplying a high percentage of the population is however not sufficient by itself. The quality of the service provided to the users is a fundamental issue, particularly where continuity of supply, water quality and reliability are concerned. Recent surveys based on simplified criteria indicate that 40% of the population supplied are thought to enjoy a good service, 54% an adequate service, and 6% a poor service.

Baseform came to exist through the intertwining of computer science and water engineering R&D, and the rethinking from scratch of many existing processes. The innovative software platform began taking shape in 2010. It has since garnered large numbers of users in all continents and been applied by dozens of utilities in Europe, USA, South America & Australia.

Research
Epanet Java
Epanet Java offers an efficient, Java-implemented Epanet simulation engine and natively integrated MSX library, for full-range hydraulic and water quality network simulation. It takes advantage of Baseform Core’s NETWORKS and its 2D / 3D network and results visualization.
Epanet Java makes available a network simulation engine that is a full Java re-write of the USEPA Epanet standard. It offers the full network modeling functionality, performing static or extended-period simulation on .INP standard model files.
Modeling details can be sought in the extensive documentation available for the USEPA’s Epanet (e.g., Rossman, 2000). The network model implemented is a rigorous, from-scratch Java implementation of the Epanet hydraulic and water quality model and of the Epanet MSX advanced water quality library. A degree of visual and functional similarity was sought in integrating it in the Baseform and NETWORKS user interface, while taking advantage of the latter’s next-generation capabilities, such as the 3D visualization.
The simulator’s implementation is particularly strong in network visualization, with the capability to seamlessly overlay on a range of publicly available maps (such as Google®, Bing® or OpenStreetMaps) or on the user’s own maps. It takes advantage of powerful charting tools that allow for full manipulation of the network’s values (parameters or simulation results), and it uses the Baseform Core’s NETWORKS 2D and 3D network displays to full effect.
At present, network editing is not available and the program is essentially intended for use with network model files prepared elsewhere. Full graphical editing capabilities are central to Baseform's roadmap and in the pipeline for 2015.
Baseform's Epanet Java is also made available through a fully programmable, open source, Java library (see below).
Epanet Java library
This tool can also be used as a standalone Java library, in a similar way to the USEPA Epanet Toolkit. This library incorporates the full Java re-write of the standard Epanet toolkit with the added bonus of a fully integrated MSX water quality engine.
Other that running it from the Aware-P app, the library may be used in 3 different ways: by linking with your code, by using the command-line interface or by running the LaunchPad.
Linking
For linking and invoking from any Java program, check the online source code and documentation on
GitHub
.
Command-line
You can run the library in command-line mode by typing:
java -cp BaseformEpaNetLib-1.0.jar org.addition.epanet.EPATool -OPTIONS INP_FILE_NAME.inp
OPTIONS are:
-T 02:00:11 (HH:MM:SS restrict to single timestep)
-N NODE_ID (restrict to a single node)
-L LINK_ID (restrict to a single link)
Output is available on the console for status messages and on two files with a tab separated, UTF-8 encoded, structure named: INP_FILE_NAME.inp.nodes.out  and INP_FILE_NAME.inp.links.out
LaunchPad
If all you want is to run simulations and analyse results, without having to write code, you can also use the library from its purpose-made LaunchPad, which allows you to:
Run hydraulic, quality and MSX simulations at full speed in Windows, Mac, Linux or any other Java-supported platform.
Export network models as regular .INP, as XML or as MS-Excel© files.
Edit the network and parameters in MS-Excel© and import back again into the launchpad (then save as .INP, if you wish).
Output detailed step-by-step, node-by-node, pipe-by-pipe simulation results in 15-digit precision MS-Excel© files.
To download the Launchpad, goto the
GitHub
location and navigate to (org.addition.epanet.ui.EpanetUI).

EpaNet Java was developed through intensive colaboration in the framework of the
AWARE-P
research project. This development, and in particular the EpaNet Java library, were only feasible given the outstanding work done at
USEPA
, namely by
Dr. Lewis Rossman
, whom we strongly thank for
Epanet
itself and for his availability and time in discussing this port.

Vision
At Baseform, we’ve combined years of applied R&D in water systems with a just as valuable track record in advanced computer development and implementation.
Since Baseform's inception in January 2015, we’ve rapidly gained a leading position in the markets where we are present, and owe it to not losing sight of a few seminal notions:
water networks are not sets of pipes, they are living organisms that jointly provide a service – we focus on making sure utilities provide the service 24/7, now and in the long run;
public infrastructures have to last beyond us, and the changes that each generation can introduce are very limited;
the software tools available on the market – billing, inventory, SCADA, maintenance – are good at their respective roles; but they scatter data, processes and sources of information away from the key decisions;
daily operation is an attention-sapper; operational decisions, planning efficiency and long-term corporate objectives have little chance of effectively aligning, unless something is done right at the root of the problem.
We have been successful at making better use of the data the utilities and cities already collect daily, and at targeting the key decisions (short- & long-term) with the right calculations, the right metrics, incorporating them in routine life.
Our site reflects a set of ideas that provide the context for the family of apps we make available to utilities, cities and the community. We believe this vision and our software can make a difference, in the water sector but also to the way in which cities make use of this ever less abundant resource.
About cities
Metropolitan areas concentrate 80% of the US population today. In 30 years, the UN estimates the same proportion will apply to the entire globe. Designing and managing cities and their infrastructures has never been so complex, and crucial.
One thing is for sure, the existing designs and design praxis must be bettered. Cities are not collections of infrastructural assets, much less static landscapes. Cities are people and we at Baseform see them move and change throughout the day, week, season, year, across each urban area.
Cities are the greatest constraints to the delivery of an infrastructural service – utilities take on a challenge that is in reality a societal challenge. Public infrastructures are there to provide a service to city dwellers, essentially in the buildings where they live, work or play. Managing cities and their infrastructures is all about understanding citizens, the places where they dwell and the way they behave, across time and space, at all times.
Growing sensorization and ubiquitous data
Knowing is a lot better than believing. As sensors multiply, we can combine data sources like never before, to reach a better understanding of human behaviors and levels of activity around the city, throughout the day and the year.
Engineering, architecture and urban planning are undergoing a fundamental revolution, where instead of relying only on projected versions of reality as in the past few centuries (models, in 20th century jargon), we can now increasingly observe that reality in detail and continuously adapt the designed landscape, facilities, infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
As far as public water infrastructures go, those needs are evidently ever changing. Not just the emerging, uncertain challenges of climate change, energy crises and their ilk, but the actual everyday fact. The short movie above, extracted from our database of over 1500 years of human consumption in cities around the world, suggests how any static urban zoning or strategic plan can easily miss reality and become a problem rather than the solution.
Ailing infrastructure
The useful life of water infrastructure pipes may range from over a century to less than a couple of decades. Cities need to re-invest accordingly. Not doing so is like not paying a bank loan – it builds up. In the US alone, the current deferred investment gap is estimated to surpass $60bn. Most major cities, with infrastructures built many decades ago, experience issues such as water shortages, leakage, tariff increases, water quality hazards.
The massive investments which are inevitably needed require long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes.
The darker blue bars in the chart show annual investment in a US city’s public water infrastructure, from its inception in the 1950s. The initial investment is mostly incorporated in the price of housing and thus borne by the initial property buyers. The white bars show current annual maintenance & rehab expenditure, at adequate levels by industry standards.
What modern society by and large has not experienced yet, is the rebound of those investment booms, as large numbers of pipes reach the end of their service lives and must be replaced (bright blue bars). This time around, the cost will not be diluted elsewhere, and the city must find ways to face expenditure needs well above the current ‘good practice’ rehab rates.
Networked infrastructures are not simply collections of assets. Extracting the best service out of capital and operational expenditure is not the same as replacing older cars in a rental fleet. Networks behave like networks; relative position and function matter. In order to maximize expenditure efficiency, we need to take into consideration the finance, the risk, but also the performance, the hydraulics, and above all, the service, where it’s delivered, and its recipients.
Technology is hardly a silver bullet, but it can help. The key are clear objectives, a good notion of how to measure them, and the will to make the right decisions.

Manifesto
Baseform is here to change the water sector, and the way communities manage themselves around this essential resource.
Water infrastructures are reaching critical levels of deferred maintenance. Cities need to re-invest massively, requiring long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes. At the same time, engineering and urban planning need not rely only on models – with fast expanding sensorization, we can now increasingly observe reality in detail and continuously adapt infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
There is no better way to accomplish the envisioned changes than to share what we do with the people who can think alongside us, providing new insights and helping us take it further.
We hail from R&D, and know
from experience
how hard it is to make sure it can be useful to the industry. Two premises are foundational: start with the right data, and aim at a real problem. At Baseform, we research and learn every minute that we spend working with our client utilities, as our engines get trained and as we get exposed to never ending human experiences and an exponentially growing data pool.
Intellectual transparency and openness are core values of Baseform. We publish most of the
algorithms and methods
we develop and work with in our software. Submitting to validation by the technical community is the best way to ensure the utmost value in what we have to offer, and to give it back to the world.
Baseform Labs is dedicated to weaving a web where the water sector’s hands-on experience interlocks with the R&D and higher education communities – to foster better knowledge, to extract better value from snowballing data volumes, to listen and to learn.
Baseform Labs is the R&D ecosystem we invest in for sharing
Software
- academic licenses of our latest software, for R&D and higher education programs in academic settings; and the cases that best illustrate each application.
Data
- data-rich, 100% plausible scenarios generated and validated by our AI engines from our nigh on infinite city, infrastructure and behavioral data resources, e.g. to support MSc or PhD dissertations or the teaching of advanced topics.
Projects
- to host, support and join forces in targeted R&D efforts, offering our insights into what is most useful to investigate, not to mention our best existing software, our substantial processing capabilities and enough data to run any hypothesis against. Let us publish what we jointly find.
We welcome all engaged minds around the world who want to share our vision of change. We hope that we can help nudge R&D efforts to even better results, and make sure those results revert back to the water utilities and the communities they service.

Research
Scientific R&D does not easily reach the professional environment of urban utilities. Many useful innovations and good ideas, with the potential to translate into effective gains, are lost to the fragmentation of research groups and projects.
The applications on Baseform are new and innovative from the
technology
viewpoint, but above all through the incorporation and development of good science and engineering in solutions that directly address water service processes from a clean slate, rather than adapting from generalist software notions.
What has been achieved with Baseform is a long-term R&D roadmap and roll-out strategy, connecting software development with the industry and a network of leading public research organizations. This has generated a strong sense of alignment in successive projects – and not least, essential funding – enabling a coherent line of solutions around some of the main engineering and management processes in urban water utilities.
WERF/USEPA at Gwinnett County (GA, USA)
Under the sponsorship of the Water Environment Research Foundation (

iPerdas – managing water & energy losses in water supply systems
Improving efficiency in water supply systems, through a more rational use of energy and control of non-revenue water, is one of the main goals of utilities. Despite important advances in the service levels provided, the values of non-revenue water – unbilled authorised consumption and water losses – are unacceptable in many utilities worldwide. This issue has gained additional importance in countries where water demand and revenue are decreasing or where water scarcity problems exist. Conversely, energy costs associated with system operation tend to be very significant; every measure to increase energy efficiency may have a significant economic impact. Furthermore, due to the water-energy nexus, integrated management of both resources in water supply systems will lead to expressive economic, socio and environmental benefits.
iPerdas
,  the National Initiative for the Management of Water & Energy Losses, is a collaborative programme led by
LNEC
(Portugal), whose 2014 edition saw 16 water utilities develop their own water & energy losses programme following a joint training and capacitation schedule. The project is supported by a specific deployment of Baseform software and includes the development of new modules for water & energy balance audits and for flow analysis.
The programme also aims to contribute to more reliable and organized processes for water-energy management inside water utilities. Technical assistance to the participating utilities is ensured by LNEC, IST – Tech. Uni. Lisbon, ITA (Polytechnic University of Valencia) and Addition, Baseform.com's precursor in the development of the software platform with the same name. The participating utilities receive collective as well as one-on-one support, specific training, and benefit from networking with other utilities in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The programme is run on a biennial basis and the next edition is slated for 2016.

AWARE-P
AWARE-P
AWARE-P (2008-2011) was a seminal R&D project designed with the aim to develop and implement in water utilities a structured procedure for infrastructure asset management.
The prevailing low levels of rehabilitation of existing water infrastructures worldwide are a major threat to the long-term sustainability of urban water services — a time bomb largely invisible to society and policy-makers, placing an unreasonable burden on coming generations. A paradigm shift in infrastructure asset management (IAM) is urgently needed in order to cope with capital-stressed contexts and ever-stringent drivers such as climate change or environmental protection. In Portugal, as in many other countries, 3 decades of capital investment focusing on new infrastructure have had a major impact on service coverage and quality, but have also left an ever-widening gap in deferred rehabilitation of the existing infrastructure.
Learning from leading know-how and practice (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, EU research and IWA’s network of professionals), LNEC partnered with other R&D organizations, software developers and utilities in the AWARE-P project to jointly develop a ground-breaking IAM planning methodology, supported by technical guides and a professional-grade, innovative software, plus e-learning and demo cases. A rollout & capacitation stage implemented through national-level initiatives, such as the LNEC-led iGPI, allowed the methods and software to be validated and refined while supporting the effective, on-field development and implementation of IAM methodologies by over 30 utilities.
Today, over 25% of Portugal’s population are served by utilities that have produced their corporate strategic and tactical IAM plans based on the AWARE-P methodology and templates — endorsed by the national water services regulator ERSAR — with widespread use of the open-source software, effectively creating alignment and critical mass for much-needed change. This has been supplemented by 2 utilities in Spain and one in the USA, with a pilot starting in Australia in 2013; while the AWARE-P software has over 1000 registered users in 5 continents. IWA’s LESAM 2013 singled out Portugal’s disruptive IAM program in its conclusions, while WERF and USEPA (USA) are promoting uptake of the innovative methodology and further development of the software in the USA, and the World Bank’s Danube Water Program has expressed an interest in the rollout formula utilized in the project. Given the diversity and representativeness of Portugal’s water market, this project provides a valuable blueprint for similar development elsewhere.
Background: previous R&D projects
The CARE-W (Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Water Networks, 2001-2004) and CARE-S (Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer Networks, 2002-2005) research projects, developed under the EU's 5th Framework-Program and with significant contributions from AWARE-P partners Sintef (Norway) and LNEC (Portugal), produced methodologies and computer prototype applications for assisting water and wastewater utilities in planning rehabilitation interventions.
These projects were fundamental stepping stones in the establishment of structured approaches and their implementation into dedicated instruments. However, the resulting software prototypes, while fully functional, still needed some computational development before they can be widely used in the water industry.
AWARE-P is a direct successor of those two efforts, trying from the outset to reach the industry and society with useable, effective products that can make a difference in capacity building and support to the planning process.
Coordination & Team
AWARE-P was largely due to the vision and determination of Helena Alegre (LNEC), project initiator and scientific coordinator, and a leading worldwide expert on infrastructure asset management of urban water services. Sergio Coelho (LNEC) joined the team as Project Manager in October 2009; software development was led by Diogo Vitorino and the Addition team.
Aware-P relied on a cross-disciplinary core team from LNEC (Portugal), IST (Portugal), Addition (Portugal), Sintef (Norway) and Ydreams (Portugal), with support from the Portuguese water services regulator ERSAR and 4 partner utilities: AdP, AGS, SMAS de Oeiras-Amadora and Veolia Mafra. The Aware-P partner utilities were an integral part of the development effort and productive contributors to all aspects of the project, under the leadership of Luís Mamouros, João Feliciano, Julieta Marques and Rui Rua/ Pedro Pereira, respectively.

The 2013 edition of the program involved 19 utilities in Portugal (see above). The 2015 edition (Jan through Dec) involves 18 utilities in Portugal and Spain (below).
iGPI was launched to help broaden the impact of the
AWARE-P project
's products, and to reach out to utilities nationwide in a significant way. The project is led and coordinated by LNEC, who ensure training and technical development support to the participating utilities together with IST (Technical University of Lisbon) and Addition. The initiative utilizes a collaborative format pioneered by LNEC in the last decade, aimed at assisting a representative sample of utilities of diverse size and context develop their own IAM systems and plans through a joint training and capacitation program.
The project is not only an intensive user of Baseform's AWARE-P software, in a multi-stakeholder setup that tests its collaborative and technical qualities in everyday professional environments; it also contributes to its range of open-source tools and capabilities.
The water utilities that take part in the iGPI project range from 3,000 to 400,000 in population served, with a large diversity of scope (water, wastewater, storm water), institutional framework (e.g., municipal, inter-municipal, concession), organizational sophistication and IT maturity.

Manifesto
Baseform is here to change the water sector, and the way communities manage themselves around this essential resource.
Water infrastructures are reaching critical levels of deferred maintenance. Cities need to re-invest massively, requiring long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes. At the same time, engineering and urban planning need not rely only on models – with fast expanding sensorization, we can now increasingly observe reality in detail and continuously adapt infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
There is no better way to accomplish the envisioned changes than to share what we do with the people who can think alongside us, providing new insights and helping us take it further.
We hail from R&D, and know
from experience
how hard it is to make sure it can be useful to the industry. Two premises are foundational: start with the right data, and aim at a real problem. At Baseform, we research and learn every minute that we spend working with our client utilities, as our engines get trained and as we get exposed to never ending human experiences and an exponentially growing data pool.
Intellectual transparency and openness are core values of Baseform. We publish most of the
algorithms and methods
we develop and work with in our software. Submitting to validation by the technical community is the best way to ensure the utmost value in what we have to offer, and to give it back to the world.
Baseform Labs is dedicated to weaving a web where the water sector’s hands-on experience interlocks with the R&D and higher education communities – to foster better knowledge, to extract better value from snowballing data volumes, to listen and to learn.
Baseform Labs is the R&D ecosystem we invest in for sharing
Software
- academic licenses of our latest software, for R&D and higher education programs in academic settings; and the cases that best illustrate each application.
Data
- data-rich, 100% plausible scenarios generated and validated by our AI engines from our nigh on infinite city, infrastructure and behavioral data resources, e.g. to support MSc or PhD dissertations or the teaching of advanced topics.
Projects
- to host, support and join forces in targeted R&D efforts, offering our insights into what is most useful to investigate, not to mention our best existing software, our substantial processing capabilities and enough data to run any hypothesis against. Let us publish what we jointly find.
We welcome all engaged minds around the world who want to share our vision of change. We hope that we can help nudge R&D efforts to even better results, and make sure those results revert back to the water utilities and the communities they service.

Symbolic Outlier Detection applied to the Analysis of Drinking Water Consumption
Thesis
2019
Pedro Borralho
Interval-valued data, symbolic principal component analysis, robust statistics, drink- ing water consumption, water distribution systems.
Principal Component Analysis is a popular statistical method for dimensionality reduction and has been extended to interval-valued data by several authors. Four of this most common symbolic principal components estimation methods have a unified formulation, namely the Centers and Vertices Methods, Complete Information Principal Component Analysis, and Symbolic Covariance Principal Component Analysis. A meticulous simulation study is conducted to compare several robust estimators of symbolic Principal Components for interval data, which use robust symbolic covariance matrices. The robust versions of the four estimation methods in study are compared with their classical counterparts. The simulation study is accompanied by visualisations of the various types of contamination used, which helps to understand what are considered to be outliers in interval data. In addition, an outlier detection method based on robust interval principal components was devel- oped. An initial comparison study was conducted, to assess the performance of the method proposed, in particular to compare with another existing proposal for outlier detection in interval data. The potentialities of the developed methodologies are illustrated with their application to a real- life dataset of drinking water consumption of more than 90 000 clients, served by a large urban water supply system in a Portuguese utility. Using the geographic identification of the clients provided by the utility, the results of the symbolic principal components are also represented in maps through the use of the Baseform software. The outlier detection procedure is used to identify and characterise clients with anomalous consumption behaviours.

STE - A Survival Tree Ensemble : Application to the Prediction of Pipe Failures in Water Supply Systems
Thesis
2019
Inês Oliveira
Infrastructure Asset Management, Water Distribution Systems, Failure Prediction, Machine Learning, Survival Analysis.
Drinking water is provided to the majority of population through a complex water distribution system, which is constantly affected by economic constraints, climate changes, infrastructure deterioration, and increasing urbanisation and customer demand. Hence, water utilities are challenged with a demanding task and, they are forced to venture in long-term strategies which direct their efforts in planning and prioritisation of rehabilitation actions. Despite the common reactive approach in which water utilities base their efforts, they are recently moving towards a more proactive approach and using failure prediction strategies in infrastructure asset management. This project’s goal is to apply machine learning techniques to build prediction models and evaluate their performance when compared to existing approaches such as the one implemented by Baseform. Failure data is characterised by some important specificities, such as recurrent events, left-truncation and right-censoring, which distinguish it from other types of data. Tree-based models emerge as ap- pealing approaches to model time until the next failure, which combine the strengths of survival analysis with the most recent developments in machine learning. To prevent the potential instability caused by individual trees, ensemble techniques arise as an alternative methodology. In pair with the Baseform model, all methods are capable of obtaining equally satisfactory results (sometimes surpassing the existing approaches) and ranking pipes with higher risks of failing. From the work developed so far, it is noticeable that survival analysis combined with machine learning techniques is a broad field of possibilities, which can bring many benefits to failure analysis in water distribution systems.

Short- to long-term asset management driven by utility-wide data analytics
Conference Proceedings
IWA 8th Leading-Edge Strategic Asset Management (LESAM)
Vancouver, BC, Canada
2019
Jennifer Suttles /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
asset management, infiltration & inflow., inspections, sewers
For over a decade, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) of Gwinnett County (GA, USA) has developed a robust work order and inspection history within its Computerized Maintenance Management System. DWR has recently taken the next step in this asset management journey, leveraging over 43,000 pipeline inspection records and 30,000 work orders, in conjunction with comprehensive flow monitoring coverage, to 1) predict areas with high probability of operational failure, 2) predict areas with high probability of structural failure, and 3) develop deterioration curves for the various cohorts of pipe, informing the long-term renewal process. This prediction allows DWR to target inspections and proactive O&M where failure is most likely, as well as definitively plan for long-term renewal investment (Suttles et al., 2019). The three components of the approach concurrently evaluate infiltration and inflow (I&I), inspections and work orders, in order to address: (i) excessive I&I, a symptom of structural deterioration and a cause of increased pumping, treatment and reclamation costs, lower efficiencies and service levels, and public and environmental liabilities; (ii) excessive reactive O&M levels, driving higher costs and impacting levels of service (overflows, backups); and (iii) capital expense, crucially tied to controlling asset deterioration and determining how best to prioritize available funds to renew or rehabilitate for maximum sustainability.

Infiltration/Inflow (I/I), Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Sanitary sewer, asset management, flow metering, inspections, work orders.
The Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources has established an advanced, multi-pronged approach to short- and long-term asset management for its 3,000-mile gravity sanitary sewer system, with the goals of predicting 1) areas with high probability of operational failure, 2) areas with high probability of structural failure, and 3) deterioration curves for the various pipe cohorts, informing the long-term renewal process. An application of software-based analytics is described that represents a step forward in decision-making used to drive asset inspection, maintenance and capital project prioritization. The components above are jointly addressed in a mutually informative, permanently available software, providing clear, defensible, quantified overall prioritization of capital and operational expenses. Advanced analytics are brought together in a multi-criteria, optimized framework designed to continuously update itself and provide both operational and structural support on demand. The paper presents the analytics methods used, a detail of key results and their discussion, and provides an overview of the multi-criteria framework deployed to support the prioritization of assets, sub-basins and projects.

Variable importance, mutual information, random forests, sewer failure prediction models, stepwise search
© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group When defining the variables to predict sewer failure and therefore optimise sewer systems maintenance, it is important to identify the ones that most significantly influence the quality of the predictions or to define the smallest number of variables that is sufficient to obtain accurate predictions. In this study, three different statistical variable selection algorithms are applied for the first time to identify the most important variables for sewer failure prediction: the mutual information indicator, the out-of-bag samples concept, based on the random forest algorithm, and the stepwise search approach. The methods were applied to a real data-set that consists of the categorisation of sewer condition and associated physical characteristics. The mutual information and the stepwise search methods provided good predictions while those obtained using out-of-bag samples based on random forest were somewhat different, justified by the lack of robustness to imbalanced class distributions.

Failure Prediction: Applying Statistics To Open Data And Continuous Data Acquisition
Conference Proceedings

Porto, Portugal
2018
Margarida Azeitona /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
GIS, Water distribution systems, failure prediction, infrastructure asset management, prioritization strategies
The prediction of pipeline and service line failures, and the prioritization of rehabilitation efforts, play an important role in infrastructure asset management. Traditional condition assessment methods for water pipes are commonly associated with time- and resource-consuming tasks, that are either expensive, inaccurate, or both. Often, these physical methods cannot be applied to the entire system, so the results cannot inform the decision-making process in a structured manner. Several scientific approaches focused on lifetime assessment and failure forecasting have emerged in recent years aiming to identify the most failure-prone pipes and help prioritize system rehabilitation actions in a non-invasive but highly informed and utility-specific way. Failure Analysis, like other Baseform apps, is designed for real data with common, everyday problems, combining breakthrough statistical tools with continuous utility data acquisition. It is therefore prepared to cope with data gaps and inconsistent information, and it takes full advantage of more data-rich scenarios if and when they become available. This paper presents some key technological aspects and capabilities available in this application, illustrating them through examples from a case study at a large utility where the software is in daily use.

IT systems, asset management, big data, decision-making
Infrastructure asset management (IAM) of mature urban water infrastructures should address the overall process of balancing out capital improvement, rehab and operational & maintenance expenditures over the long term, faced with given strategic objectives, translated into service (performance), cost and risk targets. The ability to follow the entire network in its daily management is at the base of structured short- to long- term IAM procedures. When data collection for these purposes is embedded in everyday activity, continuously making available the key metrics used for diagnosis and prioritization of assets, zones and systems, it gains in validation and repeatability and avoids becoming a tedious chore to be undertaken once a year with piecemeal results. Baseform is a web-served SaaS (Software as a Service) environment designed from scratch to aggregate multiple data sources on a continuous basis, in order to make them available specifically to the analytics and procedures required to fully support IAM in the water utility through a process- focused applicational portfolio. This paper presents the main technology aspects and analyses available in the software, the advantages of serving it as SaaS, the benefits of a fast-growing scale, and illustrates the above with concrete real-life cases.

Leak detection over mid- to long-term horizons
Conference Proceedings

2017
Margarida Azeitona /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
demand pattern, flow metering, leak detection, water distribution systems, water losses
Real-time monitoring of DMA can be a powerful tool for improving the efficiency of water supply systems and reduce losses. However, in large systems it is unrealistic to be permanently attentive to all zones without automatic monitoring tools, assisting the operations teams in thoroughly monitoring the entire network and systematically tracking down, collecting and validating all relevant information produced. Several sophisticated algorithms, based on robust statistical models and historical flow data, are continuously used by Baseform to accurately predict water demand patterns and to establish whether the consumption recorded, during a specific period, is normal or may reveal abnormal events. The strategic concern of the utility with prioritization of DMA and planning of O&M drive a search for reliable mechanisms to detect outliers, i.e., monitored values that lie outside of normality. This paper introduces a procedure for identification of trends in minimum night flow for mid- to long-term horizons, particularly useful in the early detection of ongoing leaks before they escalate into catastrophic bursts. The main advantages of this approach are illustrated through selected cases of detected events that empowered benefits to day-to-day operations, in a large urban water supply system in a Portuguese utility where the software is in use.

Crowdsourcing Infrastructure Asset Management Data and Analysis Results

Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Diogo Vitorino /  Margarida Azeitona /  Jon Røstum
IT systems, asset management, big data, decision-making
Infrastructure asset management of mature urban water infrastructures should address the overall process of balancing out capital improvement, rehab and operational & maintenance expenditures over the long term, faced with given strategic objectives, translated into service (performance), cost and risk targets. As sensors and data sources multiply (SCADA, telemetry, AMR, billing, work orders, GIS, inspections, models), urban water networks generate very large amounts of information on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. Engineering, architecture, and urban planning are undergoing a fundamental revolution — instead of relying only on projected versions of reality (often made decades ago), we can now increasingly observe that reality in detail and continuously adapt the designed landscape, facilities, infrastructures, etc., to the changing needs and intensities. Baseform is a web-served SaaS (Software as a Service) environment where a portfolio of process-focused apps are made available to a managed, unlimited universe of users inside the organization. The data are acquired from their sources through automatable upload, avoiding data migration or the need to replace the existing IT systems. This paper presents the main technology aspects and analyses available in the software, the advantages of serving it as SaaS, the benefits of a fast-growing scale, and illustrates the above with concrete real-life cases.

LEYP, Robust decision trees, Weibull regression, blockage failure prediction, non-homogeneous and zero-inflated Poisson processe, sewer system rehabilitation and maintenance
Failure prediction plays an important role in the management of urban water systems infrastructures. An accurate description of the deterioration of urban drainage systems is essential for optimal investment and rehabilitation planning. In the study presented in this paper, a new method to predict sewer pipe failure based on robust decision trees is proposed. Five other different stochastic failure prediction models – the non-homogeneous Poisson process, the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process, classical decision tress (CART and Random Forest algorithms), the Weibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process – are also implemented and explored in order to identify models that combine good failure prediction results with robustness. The six models were tested on the asset register and pipe failure register of a large US wastewater utility; only pipe blockage failures were considered in this study.

Automatic, dynamic parametrization of consumption patterns in water supply
Conference Proceedings
17º ENASB, Sep 14-16
Guimarães, Portugal
2016
Margarida Azeitona /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Diogo Vitorino
adaptative models, changepoint detection, demand pattern, flow metering, water distribution systems
Several methodologies can be applied to predict the 24-hour demand pattern in district metering areas (DMA) of water distribution systems. However, in most cases, it is essential to know in advance the characteristics of each flow time-series, to choose the most suitable combination of parameters to use as the input of the method. In particular, the demand pattern derived is dynamic and may be influenced by the period of time considered. An adaptive predictive model of the pattern based on some selection criteria, which automatically choose the most appropriate parameterizations is described, in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks. This new approach is built on the concept of weighted percentiles, allowing the prediction to quickly adjust to changes in consumption habits, seasonality and other trends. The proposed procedure has undergone extensive testing and validated through the application to a large number of DMA, as preparation for use in a commercially deployed software.

Maria Adriana Cardoso /  Ana Poças /  Maria Santos Silva /  Rita Ribeiro /  Maria do Céu Almeida /  Rita S. Brito /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Helena Alegre
Infrastructure asset management, Strategic planning, Tactical planning, Urban water services
The requirement to provide continuously the urban water services while infrastructures are ageing, impose the need for increasingly sustainable infrastructure asset management (IAM). To achieve and maintain the adequate levels of service, the AWARE-P IAM methodology has been applied in collaborative projects launched by the National Civil Engineering Laboratory, in partnership with IST (Technical University of Lisbon), Addition (software company) and several water utilities. The objective of these projects is to support urban water utilities in the development, implementation and maintenance of IAM plans. To guarantee the success of IAM planning, following the AWARE-P IAM methodology, utilities are required to: consider that the infrastructure has system behaviour and lifespan is indefinite and guarantee the full-alignment of IAM planning with organisation objectives. By analysing the strategic and tactical plans of participating utilities, the proposed methodology principles are discussed and supported. The main innovation results from the implementation of IAM planning are also presented and discussed, including the challenges of setting up an IAM process, together with the major benefits and drawbacks that come up when developing IAM plans. The results were demonstrated by the effective implementation of 16 strategic and 14 tactical IAM plans by the participating utilities.

Infrastructure asset management-the TRUST approach and professional tools
Journal Article
Water Science & Technology: Water Supply
2016
Helena Alegre /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Diogo Vitorino /  Dídia I. C. Covas
Asset management, Decision-making, Long-term, Strategic planning, Tactical planning, Water infrastructure management
Strategic asset management (AM) of urban water infrastructures faces the challenge of dealing with expensive and long-lasting assets of a very diverse nature and wide-ranging useful lives and costs. Typically, utility managers inherit an infrastructure with assets in assorted conditions and stages in their lifecycle. They are expected to manage their value in order to ensure adequate service, and make sure that what they pass on to their successors is capable of continuing to do so. Long-term vision is needed, and sound transition paths must be sought in order to ensure that urban water services are sustainable, without jeopardizing the quality of the service provided during the transition. Focusing on the transition to more sustainable services, the TRUST project revisited the concept of sustainability, explored pressures and drivers, and developed and tested a roadmapping methodology to cope with the implementation of disruptive solutions. Leading-edge analysis and assessment methods and tools were developed, multiple technologies were tested, scientific and guidance publications were produced. All of this can be explored and absorbed into a coherent management process. This paper describes the TRUST approach for infrastructure AM, addressing strategic, tactical and operational planning, supported by professional-grade software. © 2016 IWA Publishing.

2016
Mark S. Morley /  Diogo Vitorino /  Kourosh Behzadian /  Rita Ugarelli /  Zoran Kapelan /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Maria do Céu Almeida
Decision support system, Intervention strategy, Risk, Water metabolism model
A decision support system (DSS) tool for the assessment of intervention\nstrategies (Alternatives) in an urban water system (UWS) with an\nintegral simulation model called `WaterMet(2)' is presented. The DSS\npermits the user to identify one or more optimal Alternatives over a\nfixed long-term planning horizon using performance metrics mapped to the\nTRUST sustainability criteria. The DSS exposes lists of in-built\nintervention options and system performance metrics for the user to\ncompose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the\nWaterMet(2) model, and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may\nbe specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS. A\nmulti-criteria decision analysis approach is employed within the DSS to\ncompare the defined Alternatives and to rank them with respect to a\npre-specified weighting scheme for different Scenarios. Two rich,\ninteractive graphical user interfaces, one desktop and one web-based,\nare employed to assist with guiding the end user through the stages of\ndefining the problem, evaluating and ranking Alternatives. This\nmechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare\ndifferent strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple\nScenarios. The efficacy of the DSS is demonstrated on a northern\nEuropean case study inspired by a real-life UWS for a mixture of\nquantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate how the\nDSS, integrated with an UWS modelling approach, can be used to assist\nplanners in meeting their long-term, strategic-level sustainability\nobjectives.

Visual Decision Support Tool for Supporting Asset Management Performance, Risk, and Cost Analysis
Report
2016
Bradley Jurkovac /  Helena Alegre /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Managing urban water infrastructures faces the challenge of jointly dealing with assets of diverse types, useful life, cost, ages and condition. Service quality and sustainability require sound long-term planning, well aligned with tactical and operational planning and management. In summary, the objective of an integrated approach to infrastructure asset management is to assist utilities answer the following questions: The AWARE-P approach ([www.aware-p.org][1]) offers a coherent methodological framework and a valuable portfolio of software tools. It is designed to assist water supply and wastewater utility decision-makers in their analyses and planning processes. It is based on a Plan-Do-Check-Act process and is in accordance with the key principles of the International Standards Organization (ISO) 55000 standards on asset management. It is compatible with, and complementary to WERF's SIMPLE framework. The software assists in strategic, tactical, and operational planning, through a non-intrusive, web-based, collaborative environment where objectives and metrics drive IAM planning. It is aimed at industry professionals and managers, as well as at the consultants and technical experts that support them. It is easy to use and maximizes the value of information from multiple existing data sources, both in data-rich and data-stressed environments. This project aimed at testing, validating, and tailoring the AWARE-P approach and software in the U.S. wastewater services context; developing new open-source software tools.

Dália Loureiro /  Conceição Amado /  André Martins /  Diogo Vitorino /  Aisha Mamade /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
flow measurement, flow patterns, outliers, pipe burst, real water losses, water distribution systems
Methods to detect outliers in network flow measurements that may be due to pipe bursts or unusual consumptions are fundamental to improve water distribution system on-line operation and management, and to ensure reliable historical data for sustainable planning and design of these systems. To detect and classify anomalous events in flow data from district metering areas a four-step methodology was adopted, implemented and tested: i) data acquisition, ii) data validation and normalization, iii) anomalous observation detection, iv) anomalous event detection and characterization. This approach is based on the renewed concept of outlier regions and depends on a reduced number of configuration parameters: the number of past observations, the true positive rate and the false positive rate. Results indicate that this approach is flexible and applicable to the detection of different types of events (e.g., pipe burst, unusual consumption) and to different flow time series (e.g., instantaneous, minimum night flow).

collaborative project, infrastructure asset management, strategic planning, tactical planning, urban water services
iGPI, the National Initiative for Infrastructure Asset Management is a Portuguese collaborative project led by LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory, Portugal) through which 19 water utilities develop their own infrastructure asset management (IAM) systems and plans in a joint training and capacitation programme. Technical assistance to the participating utilities is ensured by LNEC, IST (Technical University of Lisbon) and Addition, a software development company. The water utilities get collective as well as one-on-one support and specific training. They benefit from networking with the other utilities in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The developed products, including training materials, templates and guidelines for developing strategic and tactical IAM plans, are available to the general public. This project has greatly contributed to the establishment of reference methodologies and standards for IAM planning, in a range of utilities of widely diverse size and context, effectively defining an accepted best practice. This paper discusses the project's format and its advantages, and goes on to describe the main outcomes, including selected cases and final products.

Data Mining techniques to predict sewer condition
Thesis

Class imbalance, Classification, Random Forest, Wastewater pipes
The proper management of wastewater pipes is an important issue in today’s society, with serious financial and health implications. The ability to adequately prioritise maintenance inspections on these pipes may consequently significantly increase the quality of life of the affected populations. In this thesis, techniques to achieve this are studied. Using Data Mining procedures the goal is to be able to predict which pipes are more likely to be close to failure. The main prediction method used is the random forest, although other algorithms are also studied, in particular, conditional forests, logistic regression and Naive Bayes. To have a more global view of the problem, as well as to be able to obtain better predictions, variable selection techniques are also studied and applied, namely, mutual informa- tion and step-backwards search. Since it was found that (fortunately) only very rarely are pipes found to be in poor state, the examination of the problem extends to class balancing methodologies. Results show that there is no clear winning algorithm, although both ensembling and class balancing techniques manage to boost the performance of the tested algorithms. The results obtained are com- plemented by confidence measures to try to placate variability. Parallel to this investigation, a restriction of the problem to the pipes having a specific type of damage is conducted, and its results compared with the more general model.

Infrastructure asset management, Strategic planning, Tactical planning, Urban water services
The requirement to provide continuously the urban water services while infrastructures are ageing, impose the need for increasingly sustainable infrastructure asset management (IAM). To achieve and maintain the adequate levels of service, the AWARE-P IAM methodology has been applied in collaborative projects launched by the National Civil Engineering Laboratory, in partnership with IST (Technical University of Lisbon), Addition (software company) and several water utilities. The objective of these projects is to support urban water utilities in the development, implementation and maintenance of IAM plans. To guarantee the success of IAM planning, following the AWARE-P IAM methodology, utilities are required to: consider that the infrastructure has system behaviour and lifespan is indefinite and guarantee the full-alignment of IAM planning with organisation objectives. By analysing the strategic and tactical plans of participating utilities, the proposed methodology principles are discussed and supported. The main innovation results from the implementation of IAM planning are also presented and discussed, including the challenges of setting up an IAM process, together with the major benefits and drawbacks that come up when developing IAM plans. The results were demonstrated by the effective implementation of 16 strategic and 14 tactical IAM plans by the participating utilities.

The aim of this paper is to present the collaborative project iPERDAS, on water losses and energy efficiency management, and provide examples of the main results achieved by the participants during 2014. iPERDAS, led by LNEC (National Civil Engineering Laboratory, Portugal), was a project through which 17 water utilities developed their own water-energy losses programmes, following a joint training and capacitation approach (www.iPERDAS.org). The group of participating water utilities was distributed across the country and supplies water to nearly 16% of the Portuguese population along 11633 km of pipes. The group was quite heterogeneous in terms of dimension, corporate structure and level of maturity in water losses management which enabled rich discussions and sharing of best practices. Utilities have received collective as well as one-on-one support, specific training, and benefited from networking with each other in a common and simultaneous process, with similar difficulties and challenges, leading to an effective sharing of solutions. The most significant results of this project include the utilities’ Water and Energy Losses Management Plans, the establishment of solid procedures to carry out water and energy audits, the improvement of inter- departmental communication and the development of an integrated and sound organisational process for water-energy management.

Decision support system, Intervention strategy, Risk, Water metabolism model
A Decision Support System (DSS) tool for the assessment of intervention strategies (Alternatives) in an Urban Water System (UWS) with an integral simulation model called “WaterMet2” is presented. The DSS permits the user to identify one or more optimal Alternatives over a fixed long-term planning horizon using performance metrics mapped to the TRUST sustainability criteria (Alegre et al., 2012). The DSS exposes lists of in-built intervention options and system performance metrics for the user to compose new Alternatives. The quantitative metrics are calculated by the WaterMet2 model and further qualitative or user-defined metrics may be specified by the user or by external tools feeding into the DSS. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach is employed within the DSS to compare the defined Alternatives and to rank them with respect to a pre-specified weighting scheme for different Scenarios. Two rich, interactive Graphical User Interfaces, one desktop and one web- based, are employed to assist with guiding the end user through the stages of defining the problem, evaluating and ranking Alternatives. This mechanism provides a useful tool for decision makers to compare different strategies for the planning of UWS with respect to multiple Scenarios. The efficacy of the DSS is demonstrated on a northern European case study inspired by a real-life urban water system for a mixture of quantitative and qualitative criteria. The results demonstrate how the DSS, integrated with an UWS modelling approach, can be used to assist planners in meeting their long-term, strategic level sustainability objectives.

Final report with DSS methodology, software and case study from an idealized pilot city
Report
2015
Kourosh Behzadian /  Mark S. Morley /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Rita Ugarelli /  Zoran Kapelan
The report presents a detailed description of a Decision Support System (DSS) methodology and software tool for use as a decision support tool to assist in the management of Urban Water Systems (UWS). The report is divided into the following three principal sections: An initial description of the DSS methodology and modelling concept is followed by a definition of the DSS problem and the elements of the DSS decision matrix and, finally, the ranking of alternatives in the DSS. Specifically, this section describes the DSS structure which encapsulates a framework for the assessment of intervention strategies in an UWS. The internal structure of the DSS engine comprises three principle modules including Environment, Performance and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The ‘Environment’ module manages the specifications of the analysis including timing, intervention strategies, PIs, scenarios and customised model input. The ‘Performance’ module is responsible for evaluating the two categories of metrics: (1) quantitative performance metrics calculated by WaterMet2 and the Risk Assessment module; (2) qualitative metrics defined within the DSS and quantified by external tools or third-parties outside the immediate scope of the DSS. The MCDA module applies a user-configured ranking approach to the specified intervention strategies for the purposes of scoring and ranking them for each scenario and user preference combination. The principal stages of the DSS map to four steps including 1) problem definition, 2) population of decision matrix and calculation of metrics (or impact assessment), 3) ranking of alternatives and viewing detailed results and 4) viewing result modification and re-evaluation of intervention strategies. The second part describes the DSS software tool itself. Two complementary interface instances are presented for the DSS, representing Desktop and web-based tools. The overviews of both tools consist of an introduction to how input data are prepared, how to run a simulation and, finally, how to interpret results in different formats. The final part of this report illustrates the use of DSS applied to the case study problem. This describes the configuration of the DSS for the case study problem for a city which faces water scarcity problems over a 30-year planning horizon, starting from year 2015. Seven intervention strategies for ameliorating this issue are examined through both implementations of the DSS. Six performance metrics are considered including five quantitative measures and a single qualitative criterion. The analysis accommodates two rates of future population growth (i.e. low and high) can be envisaged as two individual scenarios for a 30 year planning period starting from 2010. Comparison of the intervention strategies with respect to these performance metrics is also conducted based on three weighting schemes representing differing stakeholder perspectives. These weighting schemes include equal weights, and the perspectives of the Water Company and Consumers. The DSS is able to rank and prioritise the proposed intervention strategies under different individual specified scenarios and weighting schemes and to ultimately combine them to produce a single ranking for each intervention strategy.

Boosting innovation, Capacity building, Collaborative projects, Management processes, Research rollout, Water utilities
A key worldwide challenge in most sectors is to boost the effective adoption of innovation, as underpinned by the new European Union research programme Horizon 2020, which focuses on increasing innovation in Europe from 2014 to 2020. This is particularly relevant in the water sector, often perceived as conservative and averse to change. This paper discusses the role that collaborative knowledge-transfer projects can play in effectively rolling out R&D in the water industry. LNEC (Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil) has designed a structured model based on a phased programme and a network of utilities and researchers. The paper presents the core principles, the rationale, the model and methods used, and the theoretical background, as well as the project's impact, outcomes and products. The discussion highlights the lessons learnt and provides a formal analysis of the advantages of focusing on middle management as an effective entry point, even if innovation is needed across the organization. Making training materials, guidelines, use cases, data and software publicly available after the project's end has proven to have a decisive multiplying effect. The paper also argues in favour of the collaborative model as a basis for R&D sustainability, and details on-going and planned developments. © IWA Publishing 2015.

The present paper aims at providing reference values of consumption variables and daily consumption patterns for a variety of scenarios based on rigorous analysis work over 37 different urban and peri-urban DMA (District Metering Areas) in the northern and southern regions of Portugal. A comprehensive methodology that involves collecting, processing, characterizing and profiling demand, infrastructure, billing and socio-demographic data was adopted. This paper focuses on the results obtained on consumption data characterization step. Main results have shown that the analysed regions have distinct socio-demographic, infrastructure and billing make-ups that reveal differences in terms of water consumption trends. In the north region, families are bigger, consume less water per capita comparatively to the south and have a more regular consumption throughout the day. In the south region, population is more active and consume water essentially in the morning and night periods.

Smart metering (SM) has the potential to improve distribution systems planning and operation and the overall system’s water-energy efficiency. Although numerous water utilities already explore SM systems, the main focus has been water loss management and control of large consumers’ consumption and most of the existing SM technologies are often used in isolation. Therefore, there is a need for a more integrated and complete approach that covers non-current applications of SM data on water and energy consumption. The work presented in this paper identified and validated a set of relevant applications derived from SM real-time data, that are valuable for the water utilities. Moreover, it is presented a method to test the ICT tool development that implements the applications.

Water utilities have exponentially increased the usage of software and data solutions in recent years, from daily operation to long-term planning and corporate management. The cumulative refinement of generic software approaches has led to major advances, but marginal improvements are shrinking, as the limiting factors imposed by legacy software paradigms take over. This poster describes a collaborative and pluggable software platform and project, hosting an open range of apps focused on specific reengineering of core water utility engineering processes. Software development is combined with a long-term R&D roll-out strategy, connecting with the industry and a network of public research organizations. With references to practical workflows in water utilities, the text illustrates the increased efficiency of this new software paradigm, resulting in measurable alignment of operational, tactical and strategic objectives, processes and users.

The control of water losses is a major concern in the sustainability of urban water utilities and in promoting the efficient use of this natural resource. Recent advances in telemetry technology provide high-resolution consumption data at the consumer level, allowing for a remarkable knowledge improvement on the different water balance components. However, few studies focus on systematic approaches for improving system operation and maintenance by processing and analysing large amounts of consumption data. This paper presents a new methodology to calculate real losses and apparent losses in distribution networks using data collected from telemetry systems. The methodology proposes a set of algorithms that are simple to implement. These algorithmswere tested on different districtmetered areas (DMA) to improve understanding about water loss components and have already been included in commercial software. The results showed that these algorithms are robust and allow for accurately estimating the background leakage level (and unreported leaks and bursts), detecting earlier the occurrence of bursts and providing important insights into the type of illegal water uses. The use of these approaches reduced non-revenue water by more than 10% in the majority of the DMA tested. These findings are promising and demonstrate the strong potential of telemetry systems to reduce water losses and to improve the understanding of water uses.

Helena Alegre /  Diogo Vitorino /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Long term planning, asset valuation, capital investment strategy, urban water systems
Strategic asset management of urban water infrastructures jointly deals with assets of diverse nature, useful life, cost, age and condition. Service sustainability requires a sound long-term planning, which needs assessing, among other aspects: the value of the infrastructure over time; the need for reinvestments; the impact of long-term re-investment policies. The infrastructure value index (IVI) was proven to be a powerful modelling tool for combined long-term planning of linear and vertical assets. An open-source software enables IVI assessment for both asset-by-asset detailed inventory and for simplified cohort-based infrastructure description. This paper presents the formulation, discusses the underlying assumptions and applicability, and illustrates its use for strategic planning.

Condition prediction and deterioration forecasts are crucial for long-term planning of water and wastewater systems. Although sufficiently beneficial to inspire full coverage strategies, particularly in sewers, inspections are costly and it may be valuable to prioritize them based on correlations between previous results and potentially explanatory factors (e.g., age, material). The paper reports on a detailed application of a Random Forest classification algorithm in the context of a utility's thorough ongoing CCTV inspection program and AM planning, where it has been used both for estimating the importance of potential co-variates in predicting sewer condition and in directing investment in inspections.

However, the value of profiling the 24-hour demand cycle as a central element for statistical analysis, as well as a definition of normality and behavior, is often overlooked. A reliable set of methods and algorithms including data acquisition, validation and normalization procedures to obtain reliable 24-hour demand profiling is described, aided by an efficient software implementation, validated through the application in a large number of DMA from over 40 different utilities.

The failure prediction process plays an important role in the management of urban water systems infrastructures. An accurate description of the deterioration of urban drainage systems is necessary for optimal investment and rehabilitation planning. Predicting urban drainage system and sewer pipe failures is an important challenge since available failure data often have a short failure history and incomplete records. In the study presented in this thesis, five different failure prediction models, the non- homogeneous Poisson process, the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process, decision trees, the Weibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process (LEYP), were implemented and explored in order to identify models that combine good failure predic- tion results with robustness, when applied to different pipe samples. The five models were applied to a failure data set provided by The LEYP and the zero-inflated non-homogeneous Poisson process presented the overall best results throughout the models comparison, presenting accurate predictions and a good ability to detect pipes with high likelihood of failure. Decision trees only detected pipes with high likelihood of failure when considering a short- term predicting window and the accuracy of the predictions was one of the best when using robust decision trees. TheWeibull accelerated lifetime model was one of the best when considering a medium-term prediction window but failed to predict when considering a shorter one and the expected number of failures could only be obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, which can be a time-consuming procedure.

Comparative Study of Three Stochastic Models for Prediction of Pipe Failures in Water Supply Systems
Journal Article
Journal of Infrastructure Systems
2013
André Martins /  João P. Leitão /  Conceição Amado
The prediction of pipe failures in urban water systems is a complex process because the available failure records, originating in work orders, are often short and incomplete. To identify a robust and simple model with good failure prediction results using short data history, three existing models were compared in this study: the single-variate Poisson process, the Weibull accelerated lifetime model, and the linear-extended Yule process. This work also presents modifications to these models that enable them to produce more accurate predictions and overcome computational issues for practical software implementation. The three models, together with the improvements where applicable, were applied to water supply system data provided by a Portuguese water utility, and the results were comparatively analysed to assess the accuracy of each model. The Weibull accelerated lifetime model yielded the best results among the three models, accurately predicting failures and detecting pipes with high failure likelihood; however, it is based on Monte Carlo simulations, which can be time-consuming. The linear extended Yule process could also effectively detect pipes with higher failure likelihood; however, it presented a clear tendency to overestimate the number of future failures. The single-variate Poisson process is the simplest of the three models and produced failure prediction results of lower quality.

Water utilities have addressed the operation of sewer systems with a reactive approach, and lack of data on the condition of sewers hinders the development of predictive models. In this study, customer complaint/ failure databases were used to identify the various problems that are occurring within the sewer system. Two state of the art software tools were used for comparing different statistical models that use complaints/failure databases: Fail model and SIMA model. We found that in general, the NHPP model tends to overestimate failure probability when compared with the Poisson and LEYP models; and that such overestimation is higher for smaller grid cell (or sub-catchment) areas.

The AWARE-P IAM planning software offers a non-intrusive, web-based, collaborative integration environment for a wide variety of data and processes that may be relevant to the IAM decision-making process, including maps, GIS shapefiles and geodatabases; inventory records; work orders, maintenance, inspections/CCTV records; network models, performance indicators, asset valuation records, among others. The software provides an organized framework for evaluating and comparing planning alternatives or competing IAM solutions, through selected performance, risk and cost metrics. It comprises a portfolio of system metrics and network analysis tools that may also be used individually for diagnosis and sensitivity gain. The public beta release in early 2012 garnered significant numbers of users worldwide, and subsequent versions and a growing number of utility deployments and pilots have been steadily confirming the potential of its system-based approach. It is based on the collaborative, web-based and highly modular Baseform platform (www.baseform.org), which runs wherever Java is supported, and materializes as an integrated and expandable suite of plug-in tools, taking advantage of the platform's user management, common data integration services and next-generation 2D/3D visualization capabilities with Google Earth® integration among other features. The paper describes the software’s design and main features, and illustrates its main use cases.

Chlorine modelling, Decay kinetics, Drinking water quality, EPANET
The modelling of chlorine residual in water supply systems is of great importance in managing disinfectant concentrations throughout the network. First order decay kinetics are currently often used to describe both bulk and wall chlorine consumption. However, more complex approaches have been proposed, namely a parallel, two-reactant second order decay model (2R model) that has been reported as yielding better accuracy for simulating chlorine bulk decay in laboratory tests. The recent EPANET Multi-Species Extension (EPANET MSX) brought enhanced capabilities for the simulation of chlorine residuals in water supply systems, including the use of the 2R model or any other formulation. In the current paper, the performance of the 2R model as well as of first and nthorder decay kinetics was assessed for full scale modelling of chlorine in a transmission system. Results have shown that a similar level of accuracy can be achieved with the three tested kinetic models, provided that a good calibration of the wall decay coefficient is accomplished. Although with improved modelling capabilities, the use of the standalone EPANET MSX was less user-friendly than normal EPANET application by the lack of a graphical interface allowing for the visualization of chlorine concentration profiles along the system. The use of the 3D-enabled Epanet Java web application circumvented such limitations. This tool together with a better characterization and estimation of the bulk and wall decay components allow for a more practical and accurate modelling of chlorine in water supply systems, while taking advantage of EPANET MSX's enhanced capabilities. © 2013 The Authors.

This paper presents the integrated methodology for infrastructure asset management (IAM) developed in AWARE-P, an R&D project aimed at producing adequate and effective support tools for assisting urban water utilities in decision making and rehabilitation planning (www.aware-p.org). The proposed methodology addresses all three planning and decisional levels (strategic, tactical and operational) and follows a PDCA-inspired cycle. The methodology assesses the water systems and any planning solutions along the cost, risk and performance dimensions, with a variety of standardized assessment methods and models proposed for each. It differs from existing approaches in the incorporation, into a single organized framework, of the entire IAM process with an integrated, long-term vision of the urban water network – looking at the infrastructure as a system, and not as a mere sum of individual assets. The paper describes the approach and illustrates its application with reference to the several business cases already undertaken.

Cost, MCDA, Performance, Prioritization, Rehabilitation plan, Risk
The aim of this paper is to compare sorting and ranking methods for prioritization of rehabilitation interventions of sewers, taking into account risk, performance and cost. For that purpose multiple criteria decision-aid (MCDA) methods such as ELECTRE TRI for sorting and ELECTRE III for ranking are applied in a real case-study and the results obtained are compared. The case study is a small sanitary sewer system from a Portuguese utility located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The problem to investigate is the prioritization of the sewer candidates for rehabilitation. The decision maker (a panel group of specialists) has chosen five assessment measures: water level and maximum flow velocity (hydraulic performance indices), sewer importance and failure repair cost (collapse-related consequences of failure) and the risk of collapse. The results show that the outcomes from ELECTRE III are easier to understand than those from ELECTRE TRI method. Two different sets of weights were used, and the sorting and ranking results from both methods were found to be sensitive to them. ELECTRE TRI method is not straightforward as it involves technical parameters that are difficult to define, such as reference profiles and cut levels.

AWARE, Infrastructure Asset Management, Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis
This paper presents the application of a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework to help selecting the best rehabilitation solution for a water service. MCDA is performed using different criteria from three dimension of analysis (performance, cost and risk) and is applied to a case study in Portugal. Two external scenarios, four rehabilitation alternatives and six evaluation criteria were considered to test the decision context. The ELECTRE III technique was used to rank the rehabilitation alternatives. The results obtained and the main conclusions are presented in this paper.

High levels of deferred maintenance and rehabilitation and overwhelming investment needs in urban water services infrastructure demand wise spending and innovative, efficient planning. Rather than component-centric AM approaches, such as like-for-like prioritization and replacement, the complexity of the problem must be addressed by system-centric methods that ensure the best possible compromise between performance (level-of-service), risk and financial effort. An open-source software system based on a set of tools and models that assist in the analyses and decision support involved in the planning process has been developed in order to host the methods mentioned above.

A new approach to estimating household night consumption at DMA level

Dália Loureiro /  Helena Alegre /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Rodrigo Borba
DMA, household night consumption, telemetry, water losses
The most widely used method for assessing real water losses in a district metering area (DMA) involves measuring minimum night flow and estimating what fraction of it is not ascribed to real losses. It may be further broken down into authorized household consumption, authorized non-household consumption and non-authorised uses. Household consumption is in general the most relevant and harder to estimate component. It is very much context-dependent and very few studies are published outside of the UK. This paper summarises the results achieved in a recent study carried out in two Portuguese municipalities, and describes a set of simplified rules developed to predict DMA night household consumption. These rules depend on the number of households and on their social-demographic and billing features. Once household night consumption is estimated, it can then be deducted from to minimum nigh flow monitored in a DMA or part of a DMA, contributing to a more accurate estimate of real water losses. The results obtained show significant differences from case to case, but in most cases lower values than the published UK references. This is believed to show that residential night consumption is rather context-dependent and that real losses may in fact be higher than estimated so far in this region.

Asset management, Rehabilitation planning, Urban water infrastructure
Water services are a strategic sector of large social and economic relevance. It is therefore essential that they are managed rationally and efficiently. Advanced water supply and wastewater infrastructure asset management (lAM) is key in achieving adequate levels of service in the future, particularly with regard to reliable and high quality drinking water supply, prevention of urban flooding, efficient use of natural resources and prevention of pollution. This paper presents a methodology for supporting the development of urban water lAM, developed during the AWARE-P project as well as an appraisal of its implementation in four water utilities. Both water supply and wastewater systems were considered. Due to the different contexts and features of the utilities, the main concerns vary from case to case; some problems essentially are related to performance, others to risk. Cost is a common deciding factor. The paper describes the procedure applied, focusing on the diversity of drivers, constraints, benefits and outcomes. It also points out the main challenges and the results obtained through the implementation of a structured procedure for supporting urban water lAM.

The current paper briefly presents the infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology developed in the framework of the AWARE-P project for the comparison of alternative rehabilitation solutions and applies it to a Portuguese water supply system taking into consideration different criteria. These criteria incorporate three assessment dimensions – performance, cost and risk – expressed by several assessment measures (e.g., investment cost, risks of pipe leakage, risk of pipe burst and infrastructure index value). Criteria are aggregated by a Multiple Criteria Decision-Aid (MCDA) technique – the ELECTRE III method. Alternative rehabilitation solutions were established and assessed using this approach. Results are presented and discussed.

Stochastic models for prediction of pipe failures in water supply systems

Failure prediction, Infrastructure asset management, LEYP, Poisson process, Water supply networks, Weibull regression
The failure prediction process plays an important role in infrastructure asset management of urban water systems. This process aims at assessing the future behaviour of a urban water network. However, failure prediction in urban water systems is a complex process, since the available failure data often present a short failure history and incomplete records. In the study presented in this thesis, three di erent failure prediction models, the single- variate Poisson process, theWeibull accelerated lifetime model and the linear extended Yule process, were implemented and explored in order to identify robust and simple models that combine good failure prediction results using short data history. The three models were applied to a Portuguese urban water supply system. TheWeibull accelerated lifetime model presented the best results throughout the comparison of the three models, presenting accurate predictions and a good ability to detect pipes with high likelihood of failure. Nevertheless, the expected number of failures can only be obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, which can be a time-consuming procedure. The linear extended Yule process could also e ectively detect pipes more prone to fail. However, it presented a clear tendency to overestimate the number of future failures. The single-variate Poisson process is a very simple stochastic process, that is easy to un- derstand and to apply. Due to its simplicity, this prediction process lacks the ability of di erentiating e ectively the water network pipes, which leads to lower quality individual failure predictions. It is noteworthy that no signi cant di erence between the three models results was found when predicting failures in pipes with no failure history.

planning, rehabilitation, strategies, urban water infrastructure
Urban water systems are essential to modern societies; managing them strategically is a challenge, as they require continuous and costly capital maintenance to ensure service sustainability. Wise rehabilitation and maintenance planning are therefore essential. This paper presents an application of an innovative urban water infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology, developed by project AWARE-P, to the case of the Oeiras & Amadora water utility (SMAS O&A). This IAM approach considers three levels of planning: strategic, tactical and operational, corresponding to long-, medium- and short-term horizons. One of the main advances of the approach is efficiently integrating assessment dimensions other than cost, namely performance and risk. The entire utility was considered at the strategic level and at the first stage of the tactical level. A district metering area of the water supply system was used as a pilot for testing the procedure at the more detailed level of tactical planning. Five IAM alternatives were devised, including a conventional like-for-like pipe replacement alternative and a number of optimal design alternatives that take into account energy efficiency and system resilience. After assessment and comparison, the alternative that represented the best trade-off was selected using a simple multi-criteria decision method. The application of the AWARE-P approach by SMAS O&A contributed to a shift of paradigm within the organisation with regard to rehabilitation and maintenance planning.

The AWARE-P project aims to promote the application of integrated and risk-based approaches to the rehabilitation of urban water supply and wastewater drainage systems. Central to the project is the development of a software platform based on a set of computational components, which assist in the analyses and decision support involved in the planning process for sustainable infrastructural asset management. The AWARE-P software system brings together onto a common platform the infrastructural geo- referenced data that describe the physical water supply or sewerage systems, as well as a variety of data originating in the several information systems that exist in the water utility corporate environment, such as maintenance and work orders data, billing and costs databases, or network analysis models. Building on those, it makes available an organized set of user- configurable assessment algorithms related to performance, cost and risk, which are used to evaluate alternative system configurations or planning solutions, against current and projected or hypothetical scenarios.

This paper presents the integrated methodology for infrastructure asset management (IAM) developed in AWARE-P, an R&D project aimed at producing adequate and effective support tools for assisting urban water utilities in decision making and rehabilitation planning (www.aware-p.org). The proposed methodology is organized into three planning and decisional levels (strategic, tactical and operational); at each level, a cycle based on PDCA (plan-do-check-act) principles runs through (i) definition of objectives and targets; (ii) diagnosis; (iii) plan development; (iv) plan implementation; and (v) plan monitoring and review. The methodology assesses the system and any planning solutions under consideration along three dimensions – cost, risk and performance – with a variety of standardised assessment methods and models proposed for each. Despite being based on IAM principles generally recommended and adopted by leading-edge research, consultant and utility organizations, the proposed methodology differs from existing approaches in the incorporation, in a single organised framework, of the entire IAM process with an integrated vision of the water networks – i.e., looking at the infrastructure as a system, and not as a mere sum of individual assets – in the long-term. Specific methods and software tools have been developed to assist water utilities in implementing the AWARE-P approach in the industry environment, and several business cases are available.

Use and Collection of data in Gemini V A in Asset Management
Thesis
2010
Kjersti Holte
As the water and wastewater network in Europe is declining, the recommendation is to move towards Asset Management, as this is a proactive approach to system rehabilitation. This thesis has been written at LNEC, Portugal, in cooperation with the AWARE-P team, who is developing a software to deal with future planning of rehabilitation of the network. The work has been to collect the need of data in their modules, looking at data collected from other rehabilitation softwares and comparing it to what is available in Gemini VA to value the use of Gemini VA for rehabilitation planning support. Planning tools for rehabilitation of water and wastewater networks is still in the developing phase. The programs are often data hungry, and collecting data is time demanding. Gemini VA represent a good software for collecting base data used in rehabilitation planning, and is the most used water and wastewater maintenance software in Norway. It's important to identify the limits and possibilities of the software for future development, and the goal of this thesis has been to look into improvements of the software to give better data at a lower time cost. In the Asset Management approach the condition of the network must first be decided. This analysis can be done with basic data such as material, construction year, dimension and condition factor from surveys done on the network (CCTV etc). When the condition is determined, assessments within cost, performance and risk can be completed at the strategic, tactical and operational level. Gemini VA can provide a lot of base data, but even though the data is available, the preparations is time demanding, and the only data validation feature available, is a material-dimension-construction year- validation. Therefore historical data, and the rest of the structural data, must be validated manually. Gemini VA should try to move towards an Asset Managment approach by including more validation reports, pre made statistical reports, and visualisation effects of the statistics. The software should also include cost, more information on stormwater assets, water quality tests and more pumpingstation and treatment plant information. Gemini VA can be used to collect data for a national statistical database for utilities with low or poor record of historical data to retrieve statistical numbers for planning (failure rate for different materials, etc).

Is strategic asset management applicable to small and medium utilities?

Helena Alegre
Urban water infrastructures provide essential services to modern societies and represent a major portion of the value of municipal physical assets. Managing these assets rationally is therefore fundamental for the sustainability of the services and to the economy of societies. “Asset Management” (AM) is a modern term for an old practice—assets have always been managed. In recent years, significant evolution occurred in terms of the AM formal approaches, of the monitoring and decision support tools and of the implementation success cases. However, most tools developed are too sophisticated and data seek for small utilities. The European R&amp;D network COST Action C18 ( www.costc18.org) identified key research problems related to the management of urban water infrastructures, currently not covered by on-going projects of the European Framework Program. The top 1 topic is “Efficient management of small community”. This paper addresses challenges and opportunities for small and medium utilities with regard to infrastructure AM (IAM). To put this into context, the first sections discuss the need for IAM, highlight key recent developments, and present IAM drivers, as well as research and development gaps, priorities and products needed.

Estimation of household consumption is one of the key elements in the analysis of water losses in distribution networks. Household night consumption is very specific of each network and socio-demographic context, and can vary according to multiple factors. This paper describes an on-going study aimed at assisting a Portuguese water utility in the development and implementation of a methodology to quantify household night consumption based on expedite rules, dependent on socio-demographic and billing factors. A stochastic model was developed to simulate household night consumption and was tested in 8 study areas. The paper describes the selection of case studies, the collection and processing of field data, the establishment of significant night consumption metering periods based on cluster analysis, the identification and characterization of rectangular pulse events, and the process of identification of and correlation with possible explanatory factors.

A large number of distribution network pipes in Portugal is over-sized for human demand flows, due to regulatory fire-fighting minimum diameters, which has a direct bearing on water quality, given the potentially lowvelocities it may originate. In order to assess the magnitude of the problem, a large scale studywas undertaken, based on twenty water distribution system sectors, from networks across the country, representative of a wide range of conditions. Calibrated hydraulic models developed and updated by the utilities were provided. The extended period models were used for exhaustive runs of typical operational conditions, and the results - flow velocity, pressure, head loss and Reynolds number - were recorded for the sets of time periods concerned. The resultswere analyzed by using a computer application specifically developed for this purpose.Acomplete set of statistics for the above parameters was produced. Performance assessment of water distribution systems was also performed based on the results obtained. The main conclusions were that (i) the networks are over-designed with very low velocities in most of the time (due to being designed for the peak flow conditions in 40-year time and for fire-fighting conditions) and (ii) the systems are operated with pressures higher than necessary with evident potential of water losses and energy saving.

Water distribution models, data-intensive tools, decision-making, implementation
Water distribution network analysis models are the single most influential tool in understanding existing or projected networks, and a precious aid in the assessment of evolution scenarios. As such, they are at the core of the decision-making process in any short-, medium-, or long-term asset management strategy. However, they are still less than well-established in many parts of the world, particularly in the operational and technical management environments. Experience shows that it is only possible to fully realise the potential of network models in a water utility when there is an internal structure explicitly devoted to the tasks of building, managing and updating them in a sustainable and efficient manner. Externally developed models, where often not enough attention is paid to capability building and organisational issues, have a much greater chance of being abandoned by the utility, and after relatively short life spans. Conversely, the assimilation of model-building knowledge by the utility and the establishment of specific, tried-and-tested internal procedures have shown to be a successful formula that spurs a number of parallel innovative advancements in related areas within the utility. The internal development of simulation models is a powerful strategic driver for the process of information integration across the various information systems (IS) in the utility – GIS, customer/billing system, SCADA system, maintenance IS, laboratory IS (LIMS), etc. Water utilities are massive data generators; such data is, in turn, a precious asset to the organization. Water network models are a prime example of an engineering-oriented application that is very demanding on the quantity, scope and quality of the data it deploys, particularly if correctly and sustainably developed. It so happens that such information is at the very core of the engineering decision-making process, and beyond. The information requirements involved in the well-supported establishment of a network model place demanding questions to the other systems – particularly the GIS, SCADA and billing IS – that inevitably prompt an increase in quality and depth. It makes sense, therefore, that the development of network modelling within a water utility is approached in a structured and systematic way, in order to ensure the highest possible benefit in terms of the effort and resources invested – both in the generation of the initial solutions and in their maintenance and expansion throughout their lifespan (Figure 2 shows a recommended phased strategy for model development). The National Initiative for the Development of Simulation Models (INSSAA), a program ran in Portugal between 2003 and 2006 with the objective of promoting the development and use of simulation models by the utilities, explicitly in the operational and technical management tasks, is thought to be a valuable example of the above principles. Based on phased development, training and knowledge-building strategies, common to the set of 9 participating utilities, the following main components were covered: -Human resources – modelling team set-up, mission definition and organisational fit; training in network analysis model development, use and maintenance. -Planning, development, and commissioning by the utility teams of fully functional, calibrated models of network sectors, with a strategy for full territorial coverage. -Set-up of data and organisational mechanisms and procedures for the integration of the developed tool, its efficient management and its integration with the other IS across the utility. This paper presents the INSSAA program and its stages of implementation, and focuses on the results obtained, including the core gains; the main data, human and organisational difficulties and hurdles; and the ways found to overcome them. A discussion is undertaken on the global issues involved in the efficient creation and maintenance of engineering-oriented data-intensive tools, for the operational and technical management environments of water supply utilities.

GIS application, Water distribution, pipe failure, statistical analysis
Water distribution pipe failure records are a primary source of information regarding the state of conservation of the buried infrastructure and the way it is operated. Failure can be defined as an event that requires an intervention to recover pipeline and system function. Such events are normally caused by break or collapse of pipes, and through leaks in unions. The functional effect of the physical damage is reflected in water supply interruptions that can last from a few hours to days, as well as pressure fluctuations, and flow availability and water quality changes at the consumers’ tap. Knowledge on the weakness of the network – the areas, materials or pipe types with the greatest numbers of occurrences, and the probable causes behind them, is a critical type of information for the network manager, who can act in anticipation to try and eliminate or reduce the failures, the associated costs and the drop in the levels of service at the consumers’. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a systematic process of information collection on failures in distribution systems, and to the development of tools for the prediction of failure events, based on the corresponding database of historical failures. Two examples of the latter are made available by the proprietary Care-W procedure and software (http://care-w.unife.it/), particularly through a PhM and a Poisson-based tools used to predict failure rates for classes of explanatory variables chosen by the user in a water distribution system. The methods proposed here were developed without the need for sophisticated or expensive software, and are made available based on simple MS® Excel® spreadsheets. Pipe failure records are grouped into explanatory classes of variables, and data is tested for fit to the statistical distribution used (Poisson); statistical indicators are used to evaluate if the classes have been well selected. With the failure rate for each class, and assuming a given Poisson distribution for the failures, it is possible to calculate the failure probability of each individual pipe. A GIS system (ESRI® ArcGIS 9.1®) is used in order to geographically illustrate failure rates and probabilities (Figure 1). Given those, a tool was developed for assessing the functional consequence of failure of each pipe in the network, in terms of pressure and affected demand, using a network model to evaluate each scenario. This tool was developed using ESRI® ArcObjects® and the Epanet simulator library of functions, and is fully integrated in the GIS system. Running the two mechanisms in conjunction, a quantitative measure of the risk of failure for each pipe (risk=probability of failure x consequence) can be mapped out (Figure 2). This methodology has been tested and used on the distribution system of Lisbon region municipality, with full integration of the data and results on the GIS system. It is found that the insight into the functional effect of the failures, together with the careful exploration of failure rates and probabilities, affords better supported decision-making in both operational and investment terms.

erformance assessment, rehabilitation, urban sewer systems
Urban sewer systems constitute a significant patrimony in Europe and worldwide. The structural quality and functional efficiency of sewer systems are fundamental to guarantee their good performance. These systems are nowadays facing problems of ageing, malfunctioning and overloading caused by deterioration due to long life times, improper maintenance, population growth or catchment increase. In order to effectively plan the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of sewer systems it is important to provide methods and tools for wastewater utilities in order to support the technical management of their systems. The importance of performance evaluation has been growing in most services and economic activities in recent years. Decisions must be economically and environmentally sustainable, the customer/consumer must be satisfied by the product or service provided, and legislation becomes ever more stringent and far-reaching. It is increasingly vital for the managers of an organization to know where, how and when changes must be introduced in order to reach a better performance. These decisions must be taken based on all the available relevant information. The objective of the methodology proposed in this paper is to establish, at the engineering level, the use of a performance assessment methodology suitable for the diagnosis, control and selection of solutions for the improvement of technical processes and systems performance. It can be applied to monitoring data or modelling results, in this case both to extended period operational scenarios and to a range of load factors, displaying appropriate dispersion bands (e.g. percentiles). The methodology is objective-oriented, quantitative and constitutes a standardised approach to technical performance assessment of sewerage systems as a useful contribution to the quest for a common language that would facilitate comparisons, prioritization and the setting of service standards. It is based on relevant performance variables or indicators, meaning the quantity which translates the system behaviour or properties from the point of view taken into consideration (e.g. hydraulic or environmental). It can be applied at catchment or system element level, depending on type of available data; performance functions scores the values of the performance variables or indicators against a scale of performance; for the element level assessment a generalising function is defined for extending the element-level calculation across the system, producing zonal or system-wide diagnoses. Through this methodology an overall view of system performance can be achieved facilitating performance comparisons. A case study is presented to illustrate the application.

exfiltration, infiltration, performance indicators, rehabilitation, sewer systems
The structural quality and functional efficiency of sewer systems are key parameters to guarantee the transfer of domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to treatment plants without infiltration nor exfiltration. Infiltration of groundwater is particularly detrimental to treatment plant efficiency, while exfiltration of wastewater can lead to groundwater contamination. The APUSS project associating universities, SMEs and municipalities in 7 European countries, developed new methods and techniques to assess and quantify infiltration and exfiltration (I/E) in sewer systems. This paper describes the establishment of a set of performance indicators (PI) developed to assess the impact of I/E on sewer systems and their application to three project case studies, in Italy and France, focusing on sewer systems characteristics, I/E measurements campaigns and PI application results. The methodology for PI definition consists in the selection and development of a sewer network property or state variable, which is expressive of aspects being scrutinized (I/E); the PI values are then calculated; finally, a classification of the PI values is made in relation to good or bad performance. The use of PI allows a standardized and objective comparison of the performance of sewer systems and constitutes a means to technically support the establishment of priorities for rehabilitation and/or construction investments taking into account I/E impacts.

leakage, pressure control, valve management, water distribution systems, water losses
A model to support decision systems regarding the quantification, location and opening adjustment of control valves in a network system, with the main objective to minimise pressures and consequently leakage levels is developed. This research work aims at a solution that allows simultaneously optimising the number of valves and its location, as well as valves opening adjustments for simulation in an extended period, dependently of the system characteristics. EPANET model is used for hydraulic network analysis and two operational models are developed based on the Genetic Algorithm optimisation method for pressure control, and consequently leakage reduction, since a leak is a pressure dependent function. In these two modules, this method has guaranteed an adequate technique performance, which demands a global evaluation of the system for different scenarios. A case study is presented to show the efficiency of the system by pressure control through valves management.

Water consumption, demand analysis, demand patterns, explanatory factors
Understanding the factors that influence daily and weekly water consumption patterns in distribution systems is fundamental for both long term tasks, such as planning, design, expansion or rehabilitation of the systems, and short term tasks, such as routine system operation or emergency management. This paper describes the development of a Portuguese nationwide program for characterizing residential water consumption, through the use of a specific consumption data analysis protocol and the build-up of a database of demand patterns; and for associating it with a range of easily obtained, potential relatable factors that include the technical features of the network (e.g., service pressure, network state and maintenance level, use of household tanks), billing and customer statistics and a range of social-demographic variables, such as age, social-economic level and mobility of consumers, age and type of buildings, and economic activities. The program is currently being test-run on a set of 20 metering districts from 9 water utilities, comprising a variety of network types and demand characteristics across representative urban areas of Portugal. The metering districts range in size from 2,000 to 12,000 connected properties, and have mostly been monitored since 2005 (in some cases, 2004). Total consumption is continuously monitored during the main seasonal scenarios (typically winter and summer) in the areas selected. Standardized daily demand patterns and consumption statistics are produced for each day of the week, as well as for each season, in case there is seasonality in the area. Social-demographic information is based on statistics obtained from the 2001 National Census for the basic statistical units, which are around 300 dwellings in size. After the initial run, the program is to be disseminated and made accessible to all water utilities willing to participate, on a voluntary basis and with data anonymity. This will be done mostly through a dedicated website containing the consumption database, together with query and analysis tools, as well as a supervised mechanism to submit new cases in standard format. It is believed that the publication of the result database and its continued growth will provide the water industry designers, consultants and managers with much more reliable and updated data on water consumption than previously available. It will also represent a means to estimate demand through correlation and profiling, in cases when there are no records to work from. The paper discusses the demand analysis performed, as well as the development of the set of potential explanatory factors (technical features of the network and social-demographic variables), and illustrates with the results obtained so far.

Performance assessment in urban water infrastructures is an increasingly important field of knowledge. Performance has traditionally been expressed in a variety of ways relating mostly to local design practice, with hardly any consensus on how it should be measured or compared. The efficient technical management of these systems deserves a specific approach, suited to the methodologies regularly employed while planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the systems. At the engineering level, decisions are based on operational, physical, and resources data and on analyses deploying simulation models, geographic information systems, or other information systems. However, such tools tend to produce vast amounts of insufficiently aggregated or performance-oriented information. This paper presents a performance assessment system that is based on the decisional concept of utility functions and designed as a technical analysis tool with the purpose of shifting the focus of technical management of urban drainage systems to a performance-oriented view.

Accounting for the influence of initial chlorine concentration, TOC, iron and temperature when modelling chlorine decay in water supply
Journal Article
Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology - Aqua
2004
Paula Vieira /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Dália Loureiro
Degradation of water quality in supply and distribution systems is one of the foremost problems that water companies are faced with. It is everyday practice in many countries to maintain a residual quantity of a disinfectant such as chlorine throughout the system, in order to ensure the safety of distributed water. However, the chlorine added at the water treatment plant disappears as it travels to the consumer tap, due to reactions in the bulk of the flow and at the pipe walls. This paper analyses the influence on free chlorine bulk decay of several water quality parameters, such as temperature, initial chlorine dosage, organic matter and iron content. The performance of five alternative kinetic models for describing the disinfectant behaviour is also assessed, considering both static and steady-state flow conditions. For the conditions tested, a parallel pseudo-first order model provided the best results.Although, in practice, parallel first order kinetic models fit experimental data better than the classic first order model, most water quality modelling software still relies on the latter as a base choice. The paper discusses practical conditions that may influence model selection for network simulation purposes, and the relevance of the associated errors.

This paper addresses the issue of performance assessment in water and wastewater systems by reviewing two of the tools that are available to the companies operating in this field: systems of performance indicators and technical performance assessment through simulation. The paper focuses on a technical performance evaluation framework and its application to wastewater systems. The assessment is carried out through the application of utility functions to the network’s elements, and the production of performance- oriented graphs that yield concise and informative views about the system’s behaviour. Two case studies involving a combined sewer system and a separate domestic system are presented in order to illustrate the method.

Controlling water quality in intermittent supply systems
Journal Article
Water Science & Technology: Water Supply
2003
Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Sam James /  Nawal Sunna /  Atef Abu-Jaish /  Jean Chatila
In countries suffering from chronic water shortages, water distribution systems are often operated on an intermittent basis, leaving them unpressurised and allowing ingress of contaminated groundwater, particularly in areas lacking sewerage systems. The periods of stagnation can promote microbial regrowth, further compromising water quality. On the other hand, peaks in pressure and velocity in the pipe network lead to biofilm detachment events, thus releasing microbial cells that may escape the regular quality monitoring procedures and thus increase risk for the consumer. Finally, intermittent supply requires consumers to store water in household storage tanks, which often encourage bacterial regrowth. This paper reports on research undertaken in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, the UK and Portugal, which provided an improved understanding of the factors controlling bacterial concentrations in intermittent supplies, and presents an overview of the most important aspects of water quality control in intermittently operated networks.

Dependency of bulk chlorine decay rates on flow velocity in water distribution networks

José Menaia /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho /  Adelaide Lopes /  Ema Fonte /  João Palma
Bulk decay rates, Chlorine modelling, Chlorine residual decay, Water distribution
Understanding chlorine residual decay kinetics and the factors that influence them are essential for such current tasks as siting chlorination facilities, dosage optimisation, choice of sampling locations and frequencies, and general design and operational control of drinking water networks, increasingly accomplished with the help of simulation models. Available constants for bulk chlorine decay are typically determined under static conditions. However, as for all fast reactions in water flows, chlorine consumption rates in drinking water pipes may be influenced by the existing mixing regimes, a function of flow turbulence, which is primarily controlled by flow velocity and pipe diameter. Flow velocities vary greatly in space and time in water transmission and distribution systems; pipe diameters are seldom uniform. Although both variables are readily available in the currently available network analysis simulators that implement chlorine models, such variations are not accounted for. Instead, a single preset decay rate constant is generally used for describing chlorine residual consumption throughout an entire system. In addition to highlighting the negligibleness of PVC pipe wall chlorine consumption, as such, this paper presents experimental evidence of a significant correlation between pipe flow velocity and bulk chlorine decay rates, and proposes a simple but effective approach to implement this dependency in current simulators.

The research described in this paper explores the suitability of a method for estimating the leakage-associated parameters and reaching a more plausible demand description than that afforded by traditional static estimates, when modelling the hydraulic behaviour of a water distribution system. Leakage is represented as a uniformly distributed, pressure-dependent demand and is deducted from the metered total system demand. The method relies on a genetic algorithm as the optimisation technique and uses de Epanet 2.0 programmable toolkit in order to create a general-purpose network analysis program.

Two operational modules are establlished: (1) for the evaluation of an objective-function to optimise the localisation of valves in the network system; (2) for the opening valve adjustment in order to optimise pressures through the evaluation of an aptitude function. New values of these parameters are generated randomly by using the technique of genetic algorithms; in order the system reaches its optimum value in terms of pressure minimisation (i.e., consequently leaks are minimised), and EPA’s programmable EPANET routines as general-purpose for network.

Most European water supply stakeholders have seen a good number of their existing water mains reach their expected lifetime, and high capital investments are required to renovate them. Rehabilitation is nowadays an imperative topic in the water industry agenda. Well-devised methodologies for rehabilitation planning are needed, in order to define where, when and how to rehabilitate water transmission and distribution networks. In principle, asset condition should be directly taken into consideration. However, that is a challenging task because mains are buried infrastructures, not easily inspected. Indirect measures such as performance indicators (PI) must be considered. The use of PI to monitor the evolution of mains behaviour and assist in the decision-making process is seen as one of the tools with greatest potential in this framework. This paper focuses on the work developed with regard to the selection and use of rehabilitation PI, in the scope of research project CARE-W: Computed Aided REhabilitation of Water networks.

The maintenance of a residual quantity of a disinfectant such as chlorine throughout the system, in order to ensure the safety of distributed water is current practice in many countries. Chlorine added at the water treatment plant decays as it travels to the consumer tap, due to reactions in the bulk of the flow and at pipe walls. The classic kinetic model used to describe chlorine bulk reactions in most water quality modelling software packages is a first order decay model. In practice, other models provide considerably better fits in laboratory decay tests. Therefore, when the first order model is preferred to other models for simulation purposes, it is important to evaluate the magnitude of the associated errors. This paper discusses practical conditions for the application of first order/parallel first order models, based on the study of the influence of several water quality parameters (temperature, initial chlorine dosage, organic matter and iron content) on chlorine decay. Laboratory decay tests were carried out using groundwater and the performance of five kinetic models for describing bulk decay has also been assessed.

The study and modelling of chlorine decay in distribution systems has been the subject of intense research in the last decade. This paper reports on a series of experiments carried out on a lifescale test rig in order to quantify any possible effect of hydraulic transients on residual chlorine concentrations in drinking water, comparatively to the decay in steady-state flow conditions. The results relate to two types of tests: steady-state tests were run in order to investigate the decay of residual chlorine during steady-state flow, for varying values of the Reynolds number; transient tests comprised an initial steady-state period, followed by successive transient events and a new steady-state period. The transient events were induced by rapid valve closing manoeuvres. The series of results obtained provide evidence towards the existence of a slowing down effect of hydraulic transients on chlorine decay rates, for the conditions represented by the experiment.

The assessment of performance in public utilities infrastructure is an important, yet still embryonic field of knowledge, especially as regards urban sewer systems. Performance has traditionally been expressed in terms that relate to local design practices. This has resulted in a variety of ways of assessing performance in different countries without a consensus on how it should be expressed. While performance indicators are a suitable tool for addressing the utility s performance in all its sectors of activity, the efficient technical management of the systems deserves a specific approach, better suited to the type of methodologies regularly employed while planning, designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and rehabilitating the systems. At this engineering level, decisions are made based on operational, physical and natural resources data, and on the results of analyses deploying common engineering tools such as simulation models and information systems. However, such tools tend themselves to produce vast amounts of insufficiently aggregated information, which is scarcely performance-oriented. This paper presents the application of a performance assessment system, designed as a technical analysis tool, in order to shift the focus of technical management of urban drainage systems to a wider, more rigorous, performance-oriented view. The system draws from the experience gathered in performance assessment in water supply, and is based on the decisional concept of utility (performance) functions, in order to accommodate individual sensitivities and interpretations. The system is implemented as a post-processor to sewer modelling, showing significant potential in the performance evaluation of sewer systems, and provides a decision support basis for sewer system design, diagnosis, operation and rehabilitation. A comparative study involving several subsystems of the Estoril Coast interceptor system (Portugal) is presented in order to illustrate the method.

Chun-Hou Orr /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Computer programs have been available to support various tasks in water\nsupply and distribution, from network analysis and modelling\napplications to a variety of data processing software for billing,\naccounting, network data acquisition and geographical information\nsystems. These applications have mostly grown in a fragmented way as\nthey became necessary, and evolved on their own. For example, most\nhydraulic models in use today have typically evolved from their earlier\nmodel development through step-wise improvements. With rapid changes in\nthe computing technologies only introduced and made feasible in the\nrecent years, such incremental updates often suffer from various systems\nlimitations the original architectures were not designed for. This paper\nsummarises some important aspects of the authors' experience in adopting\nthe latest computing developments, together with the current\nadvancements in hydraulic modelling and engineering for the\nimplementation of a new generation of modelling tools.

Performance in Water Distribution: A Systems Approach (Water Engineering and Management Series, 1)
Book
New York, USA
1997
Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Rigorous application of the method to different performance fields of water networks, illustrated by various case studies. Detailed analysis of key areas of water networks' behaviour, including advances in the analysis and modelling procedures that are currently available, e.g. in water quality modelling and reliability analysis. Applicable to a range of engineering problems in water distribution. Performance analysis is becoming a key issue in the engineering approach to the control of water supply and distribution systems, both as a natural process of evolution of the modelling and design methods available, and as a consequence of an ever increasing awareness of the quality of the service provided within the water industry today. This book presents a systematic approach to the analysis of technical performance of water networks by creating a framework in which a variety of concepts and criteria can be included. The system presented provides a shift in the way engineering problems are formulated in water supply, allowing greater control of analysis objectives and improved sensitivity.

Engineering information systems are characterized by both static infrastructure and dynamic time dependent data. Telemetered readings can often be relatively substantial over an extended operational period. The use of these data to support both engineering and operational decisions processes require the availability of an open and flexible data application. Design and implementation of such a system is presented in this paper.

Improving Efficiency and Reliability in Water Distribution Systems
Dordrecht
1995
Helena Alegre /  Sérgio Teixeira Coelho
Over the past twenty years a major financial effort has been made to improve the water supply in Portugal. A significant evolution can be observed, with 77% of the population currently connected to public systems and a target of 95% by the year 2000. Supplying a high percentage of the population is however not sufficient by itself. The quality of the service provided to the users is a fundamental issue, particularly where continuity of supply, water quality and reliability are concerned. Recent surveys based on simplified criteria indicate that 40% of the population supplied are thought to enjoy a good service, 54% an adequate service, and 6% a poor service.

AWARE-P
Research
Scientific R&D does not easily reach the professional environment of urban utilities. Many useful innovations and good ideas, with the potential to translate into effective gains, are lost to the fragmentation of research groups and projects.
The applications on Baseform are new and innovative from the
technology
viewpoint, but above all through the incorporation and development of good science and engineering in solutions that directly address water service processes from a clean slate, rather than adapting from generalist software notions.
What has been achieved with Baseform is a long-term R&D roadmap and roll-out strategy, connecting software development with the industry and a network of leading public research organizations. This has generated a strong sense of alignment in successive projects – and not least, essential funding – enabling a coherent line of solutions around some of the main engineering and management processes in urban water utilities.
WERF/USEPA at Gwinnett County (GA, USA)
Under the sponsorship of the Water Environment Research Foundation (
WERF
) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (
USEPA
), the INFR5R12 project brings together
GHD
,
LNEC
,
Addition
and the Baseform development platform, in order to both test the current AWARE-P portfolio of tools in the US water utility context, and to develop new tools to specifically address the analysis of wastewater network failure risks. The program also aims to provide integration of the AWARE-P IAM methods with WERF's SIMPLE framework.
The project includes a thorough test of the AWARE-P software at
Gwinnett County (GA) Department of Water Resources
, a water, wastewater, stormwater and reused water utility serving over 900,000 in the Greater Atlanta area. Development of the new modules greatly benefits from Gwinnett County's experienced and forward-thinking AM team.(

Basin-P (Portugal)
The
Portuguese Environmental Agency
's national system for hydrological basin planning and monitoring is a fully customized development on baseform.org software.
The Agency develops and reports detailed basin plans to Water Information System for Europe (
WISE
), creating the need for tools to handle strategic monitoring at the national and hydrological basin levels.
Basin-P answered these needs by centralizing the monitoring of several programmes, defining a set of uniform criteria and indicators and also by providing the means for projecting and evaluating future scenarios.
Basin-P was developed under a partnership between Baseform,
Addition
and
Chimp
.
Aware-P (Portugal, Norway)
The
AWARE-P project
aimed at providing water and wastewater utilities with the know-how and tools needed for efficient decision-making in the scope of infrastructure asset management of urban water services.
The project, partially funded by
EEA
and by the participating utilities, relied on a cross-disciplinary core team from
LNEC
,
IST
,
Addition
,
Sintef
and
Ydreams
, Portugal's water services regulator
ERSAR
, and the 4 visionary utility partners:
AdP

TRUST - Transitions to the Urban Water Services of Tomorrow
TRUST (2011-2015) is a 30-partner, integrated research project funded by the European Union. Over the course of four years and driven by the need of transformation and the wish to protect natural resources, R&D units, SME and utilities in 11 different countries research innovations and tools to create a more sustainable water future. The results are implemented and tested in 9 participating pilot cities or regions, grouped in green cities, water scarcity regions and urban/peri-urban metropolitan areas.
The objective of the project's Work Area 5 is to develop general-use integrated approaches and planning support tools aimed at the transition from current status to the desired sustainable urban water cycle services of tomorrow. These frameworks are developed both at the regional/national level and at the utility level, seeking a long-term asset management balance of performance, risk and cost, and taking into account social and political acceptance.
Baseform supports the integrated development of a range of software tools related to infrastructure asset management, including planning, sustainability metrics and GIS, as well as the broader planning framework set up by urban metabolism models. A project-wide software deployment is hosted for intensive testing by the research partners and by pilot utilities, and several new tools are growing on the Baseform platform, as innovative ideas and validated methods from leading-edge R&D teams find their way into professional implementation.

Baseform came to exist through the intertwining of computer science and water engineering R&D, and the rethinking from scratch of many existing processes. The innovative software platform began taking shape in 2010. It has since garnered large numbers of users in all continents and been applied by dozens of utilities in Europe, USA, South America & Australia.

Manifesto
Baseform is here to change the water sector, and the way communities manage themselves around this essential resource.
Water infrastructures are reaching critical levels of deferred maintenance. Cities need to re-invest massively, requiring long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes. At the same time, engineering and urban planning need not rely only on models – with fast expanding sensorization, we can now increasingly observe reality in detail and continuously adapt infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
There is no better way to accomplish the envisioned changes than to share what we do with the people who can think alongside us, providing new insights and helping us take it further.
We hail from R&D, and know
from experience
how hard it is to make sure it can be useful to the industry. Two premises are foundational: start with the right data, and aim at a real problem. At Baseform, we research and learn every minute that we spend working with our client utilities, as our engines get trained and as we get exposed to never ending human experiences and an exponentially growing data pool.
Intellectual transparency and openness are core values of Baseform. We publish most of the
algorithms and methods
we develop and work with in our software. Submitting to validation by the technical community is the best way to ensure the utmost value in what we have to offer, and to give it back to the world.
Baseform Labs is dedicated to weaving a web where the water sector’s hands-on experience interlocks with the R&D and higher education communities – to foster better knowledge, to extract better value from snowballing data volumes, to listen and to learn.
Baseform Labs is the R&D ecosystem we invest in for sharing
Software
- academic licenses of our latest software, for R&D and higher education programs in academic settings; and the cases that best illustrate each application.
Data
- data-rich, 100% plausible scenarios generated and validated by our AI engines from our nigh on infinite city, infrastructure and behavioral data resources, e.g. to support MSc or PhD dissertations or the teaching of advanced topics.
Projects
- to host, support and join forces in targeted R&D efforts, offering our insights into what is most useful to investigate, not to mention our best existing software, our substantial processing capabilities and enough data to run any hypothesis against. Let us publish what we jointly find.
We welcome all engaged minds around the world who want to share our vision of change. We hope that we can help nudge R&D efforts to even better results, and make sure those results revert back to the water utilities and the communities they service.

To utilities and society
Baseform is deeply committed to our goal of assisting society in better managing water. Under the current pandemic, that goal takes on a special and urgent meaning.

Contact us

to join in.

We are doing our best at Baseform to support society, and we believe that what we are making available can make a real difference to utilities. Naturally, this offer entails some limitations over the full Baseform software and service. It is tailored to a set of specific capabilities that target the above context and can be deployed fast with minimal training and support. We have carefully weighed this so as to provide our best contribution, without hampering in any way the full service that we provide our paying customers. We hope that we can all make this work.

Baseform is honored to have contributed to the new technical guide book of the Spanish Water Utilities Association (AEAS).
The “Guía Técnica de Gestión de Activos en Redes de Abastecimiento” (Technical Guide for Asset Management in Water Suply Networks) was launched today by AEAS during an
event
in Valencia (Spain) dedicated to Investment Needs in Water Infrastructure.
The guide is the result of work by some of the topmost experts and hands-on utility practitioners in Spain in the field of strategic asset management of water systems. Ramon Dolz and Sergio T. Coelho of Baseform are co-authors, and the preparation of the book was an extremely rich process in advancing knowledge and learning from a wealth of direct experiences.
The guide is particularly focused on providing a framework for the development of strategic, tactical and operational asset management plans. The guide is available online

A new way to explore water networks in 3D: pipe rendering
In this post we focus on a specific aspect of this upcoming technology that is anything but trivial: rendering water networks in 3D.
Baseform develops software for networked water infrastructures. Baseform’s effort in creating new, better, mathematical models, analytics and predictions must be matched by a clear, powerful user interface experience where all users can easily explore and understand those results and the behavior of water and waste water systems, and the service they deliver.
We believe that, along with more classical 2D map visualizations, a new 3D web interface is crucial for exposing the dynamic nature of water systems, in particular because terrain and elevation play a significant role.
Water networks can be represented on a 2D map, but by adding the third dimension it is possible not only to visualize the physical elements, their topography and their relation to terrain but also, and crucially, we have an extra dimension to express the values of state variables such as flow or pressure.
Background
OpenGL
, the industry standard for high performance 3D graphics, has from the outset featured native support to rendering lines with thickness.
Baseform
’s fully web-based software uses
WebGL
to allow for accelerated
GPU
usage of physics, image processing and effects as part of the web page canvas.
Unfortunately, due to specific (
Angle
and
OpenGL ES
) limitations related to the need for working with features common to all platforms, from desktop to mobile, the rendering of lines in 3D is not directly available.
This means that full, triangle-based 3D models have to be used and carefully drawn to precisely and clearly express line thickness (pipe diameters), corners/bends and line joins (pipe junctions).
Dynamic thickness, caps and miter joints
At
Baseform
next-gen research, we opted to go all the way with miter joints, with no extra geometry overhead and incorporated into dedicated 3D shader programs. These shader programs are also designed, using very little extra geometry, to render perfect caps every time.
Another challenge is the ability to both generate clear visualizations of a very large systems, from high viewpoints to detailed hi-resolution details, when zooming in to close-up views.
We decided to dynamically adjust the thickness (the diameter of each pipe), from near life-size when zoomed in, to progressively enlarged as the view zooms out. This operation depends on pixel density and we can adjust the pipe diameter to very specific sizes, in mm/inches or pixels. For example, the pipe may be shown with a 1000mm/40in diameter at the closest distance, but always have a 1.5 pixel border thickness at any zoom level.
The end game
The value of showing a physical urban infrastructure in 3D is significant as it becomes easy to understand. Where it gains surprising value is in the use of 3D to display and help understand technical information about the network, such as its hydraulics. This type of information gains not just an extra dimension for representation (e.g., relative values of nodal variables become relative heights of node-based columns) but lend themselves to translating complex technical quantities into simple representations which the lay user can understand – for example, very technical concepts such as ‘hydraulic grade lines’ become visually-appealing water surfaces.

New Research on Network Failure Prediction: Applying Statistics to Open Data and Continuous Data Acquisition
Our latest paper on this topic can be accessed via our Publications page.
Baseform's latest paper on water network asset failure prediction is now available via our
Publications page
. The prediction of pipeline and service line failures, and the prioritization of rehabilitation efforts, play an important role in infrastructure asset management.

Traditional condition assessment methods for water pipes are commonly associated with time- and resource-consuming tasks, that are either expensive, inaccurate, or both. Often, these physical methods cannot be applied to the entire system, so the results cannot inform the decision-making process in a structured manner. Several scientific approaches focused on lifetime assessment and failure forecasting have emerged in recent years aiming to identify the most failure-prone pipes and help prioritize system rehabilitation actions in a non-invasive but highly informed and utility-specific way. Failure Analysis, like other Baseform apps, is designed for real data with common, everyday problems, combining breakthrough statistical tools with continuous utility data acquisition. It is therefore prepared to cope with data gaps and inconsistent information, and it takes full advantage of more data-rich scenarios if and when they become available.

This paper presents some key technological aspects and capabilities available in this application, illustrating them through examples from a case study at a large utility where the software is in daily use.

Baseform & Northern Portuguese City to Collaborate on Maximizing Efficiency & Asset Management
We are excited to announce our latest Portuguese partnership with the Municipality of Vila Nova de Famalicão.
Our newest Portuguese partner,
Famalicão
, is a city in the northern Braga district that provides water services to its 135,000 residents via a 1000-kilometer network.
In recognition of its consistent commitment to environmental sustainability, the Blue Flag Association of Europe recently designated Famalicão as an "eco-municipality." Famalicão is also dedicated to technological innovation and integration, with a focus on its use of the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance connectivity across its sophisticated network. Given Baseform's stewardship of the environment and leadership role in the water software sector, this partnership with Famalicão is a natural fit.

Accordingly, we look forward to working closely with our colleagues at Famalicão to achieve greater efficiency for their customers—as well as empowering the Municipality, through our software, to achieve its goal of proactive asset management, in order to ensure the best service for generations to come.

Maximizing efficiency via our on-demand Water Balance indicators
Our Water Balance indicators have become even more efficient and customizable due to recent software developments.
Baseform's automated validation, syncing and combination of the available sources of flow & volume data, including SCADA/telemetry, loggers, billing and customer meter data, enables our client utilities to add the Water Balance theme to the range of on-demand indicators permanently available on the 3D user interface.
Making them available across the board has been a true game changer in the way in which all team members involved — from operations to engineering or financial — share crucially updated analytics about the same reality, queried any time, from anywhere or any device.

Grundfos and Baseform Bring Together a Global Leader in Water Technology and the Most Advanced Software-as-a-Service
Enabling powerful digital applications and customer outcomes to accelerate smart cities through intelligent, data-driven water management.
Grundfos
and Baseform today announced a collaboration that brings together one of the world's largest technology solutions providers and the most advanced software-as-a-service platform, enabling a more intelligent and data-driven water management in cities and communities around the world.
Grundfos and Baseform working together means that all data being generated by (literally) the main driving force behind water distribution will inform, and be informed by, the most comprehensive analytical software available to utilities, thus creating an ecosystem of unprecedented power and ability.
"Customers will get a comprehensive and advanced solution, which is designed to be used across the utility. It can help them realize major savings in both water and energy otherwise lost in distribution and can have a significant impact on their business and - as a bonus - also on the environmental footprint,"
said Marianne Kjeldgaard Knudsen, Group Vice President, Global Market Segment Water Utility, at Grundfos.
"Through this partnership, we mutually add valuable information and analytics to the customers' data, to offer solutions that allow them to understand and act upon their performance and sustainability, in both real time and the long term. Together we expect to strikingly improve the way water is managed."
said
Sergio Coelho
, CEO and co-founder, Baseform.
The initial focus areas include:
Exposing a growing market to Baseform's advanced water analytics, infrastructure asset management, water & energy loss management and wastewater infiltration & inflow reduction software offering
Exploring continuous hardware and software service solutions for the best customer outcomes
This new collaboration starts today with a combined offering of Baseform software and Grundfos water solutions and market strength, allowing water utilities to save time, money and water.

Baseform came to exist through the intertwining of computer science and water engineering R&D, and the rethinking from scratch of many existing processes. The innovative software platform began taking shape in 2010. It has since garnered large numbers of users in all continents and been applied by dozens of utilities in Europe, USA, South America & Australia.

Manifesto
Baseform is here to change the water sector, and the way communities manage themselves around this essential resource.
Water infrastructures are reaching critical levels of deferred maintenance. Cities need to re-invest massively, requiring long-term vision and systematic, defendable and transparent planning processes. At the same time, engineering and urban planning need not rely only on models – with fast expanding sensorization, we can now increasingly observe reality in detail and continuously adapt infrastructures to the changing needs and intensities.
There is no better way to accomplish the envisioned changes than to share what we do with the people who can think alongside us, providing new insights and helping us take it further.
We hail from R&D, and know
from experience
how hard it is to make sure it can be useful to the industry. Two premises are foundational: start with the right data, and aim at a real problem. At Baseform, we research and learn every minute that we spend working with our client utilities, as our engines get trained and as we get exposed to never ending human experiences and an exponentially growing data pool.
Intellectual transparency and openness are core values of Baseform. We publish most of the
algorithms and methods
we develop and work with in our software. Submitting to validation by the technical community is the best way to ensure the utmost value in what we have to offer, and to give it back to the world.
Baseform Labs is dedicated to weaving a web where the water sector’s hands-on experience interlocks with the R&D and higher education communities – to foster better knowledge, to extract better value from snowballing data volumes, to listen and to learn.
Baseform Labs is the R&D ecosystem we invest in for sharing
Software
- academic licenses of our latest software, for R&D and higher education programs in academic settings; and the cases that best illustrate each application.
Data
- data-rich, 100% plausible scenarios generated and validated by our AI engines from our nigh on infinite city, infrastructure and behavioral data resources, e.g. to support MSc or PhD dissertations or the teaching of advanced topics.
Projects
- to host, support and join forces in targeted R&D efforts, offering our insights into what is most useful to investigate, not to mention our best existing software, our substantial processing capabilities and enough data to run any hypothesis against. Let us publish what we jointly find.
We welcome all engaged minds around the world who want to share our vision of change. We hope that we can help nudge R&D efforts to even better results, and make sure those results revert back to the water utilities and the communities they service.

Improving disk demand of Baseform cloud servers
Baseform cloud servers securely receive and analyze data from utility GIS, billing, SCADA, metering and other systems in real-time. Part of my job is to make sure we operate at maximum efficiency and maintain scalability as the number of utilities, cities and end-users grows exponentially.
Any limitation to availability or responsiveness is effectively a showstopper for us. We recently observed a pretty nasty trajectory on the servers monitoring system, particularly on disk writes. This would eventually lead to reduced performance or to the need of adding more server instances to deal with the additional disk load.
By profiling server code and real-time behavior, the critical software process was identified – we found that the strategy for writing and updating the larger workload represented by raw time series data could be improved.
Baseform receives raw (i.e., unprocessed) metering data from flow, pressure, quality and other water network sensors; this raw data is stored and then goes through a process of data normalization and analysis, leading to dynamic demand and consumption analysis and identification of abnormal behavior and events. In the background, Baseform includes a specialized storage and time series lookup structure which optimizes server resources and processing time.
In summary, we were able to reduce disk writes by about 80%, by looking at data and redesigning the way we write in raw metering data files.
Baseform is not just about looking good – the real devil is in the detail.

Closing Out the Year by Cultivating New US & European Relationships
These final weeks of December will cap off what has been a very exciting and productive year of growth for our organization.
Our United States presence has been expanding significantly this year. We currently have a variety of large-scale projects ongoing in Texas, Georgia, and New Jersey—with more to come on the West Coast. Accordingly, over the Thanksgiving weekend,
Ken Bossung
, our Global Vice President, relocated to his home turf in California.
Within the past couple of months, we have begun working with four new utilities in Spain and Portugal—plus, one of our original clients just signed a three-year service extension. Also, via Grundfos, we recently recruited our first Polish client. Meanwhile, our marketing liaison in Lyon is in close dialogue with several utilities throughout France.
We look forward to a strong finish to this year and a robust beginning to the next, in collaboration with
Grundfos
in Europe,
SCCON
in South America, and you: our valued colleagues worldwide. Thank you.

New Scientific Paper on Sewer Failure Prediction Featured in Top Journal
We are pleased to announce that our most recent paper, "Analyzing the Importance of Variables for Sewer Failure Prediction", was selected to appear in the Urban Water Journal, a top international peer-reviewed publication.
When defining the variables to predict sewer failure and therefore optimize sewer systems maintenance, it is important to identify the ones that most significantly influence the quality of the predictions or to define the smallest number of variables that is sufficient to obtain accurate prediction. In our study, three statistical variable selection algorithms were tested: the mutual information indicator, the out-of-bag samples concept (based on the random forest algorithm), and the stepwise search approach.
To find out the results of our study and review our paper in its entirety, please visit our

Pipe failure prediction research presented at CA-NV AWWA 2019 Annual Spring Conference
Today, our team presented new software capabilities at the American Water Works Association's Spring Conference in Sacramento, California.

Results of the outstanding capabilities of our Failure Analysis software for use by water utilities were presented at the American Water Works Association's
CA-NV AWWA 2019 Annual Spring Conference
in Sacramento, California.
Session participants in this session were shown how to use software to perform continuously updated failure prediction analysis on entire water or wastewater networks, using the utility’s own GIS data and failure records such as kept in work orders, CMMS, spreadsheets or other media.

The session also highlighted the benefits of having this capability available for the utility's own use as new data is acquired through everyday O&M activities and automatically factored in. The software is designed to make it viable for the utility to use it internally without depending on external know-how. Usage of pipe failure prediction in both O&M mission critical contexts and medium- to long-term planning tasks were highlighted and discussed.

Water Industry Report: Baseform’s Asset Management Strategies to Contribute to $41 Billion in Savings
Utilities worldwide can expect exponential growth if they follow these high-tech strategies over the next decade.
According to a

new report

by Bluefield Research (an independent water industry advisory firm), advanced asset management strategies will result in at least $41 billion in savings to global water utilities over the next decade.
In their analysis, Bluefield studied nearly $3 trillion worth of drinking water, waste water, and storm water assets throughout North America, the European Union, and Oceania: 31 countries in total. Upon evaluating the asset management paradigms of an elite group of international SaaS companies—including Baseform—Bluefield concluded that water utilities’ capital expenditures would decrease exponentially if they adapted these types of pioneering technologies.
Baseform, which was recently named by the European Commission as a "
key innovator
," is honored to be at the vanguard of this asset management revolution. Bluefield’s full report can be accessed via this

press release
