Practical Information
Information on this page is outdated corresponding to data collected in 2005. It will not be updated and may still provide some useful information. Moving and updating practical information to the new euraxess.pt portal is one of our current priorities. At a later stage this will be followed by Jobs information. Both portals will coexist during a period of months and we intend to fully preserve the eracareers jobs data in the new setting or other portals operated by FCT. We invite you to browse
www.euraxess.pt
which is rapidly changing.
Find information about living conditions in Portugal. For further local 
						information we advise you to contact a Researcher’s Mobility Centre, preferably 
						the closest to your desired destination.

PORTUGUESE RESEARCH POLICY
The Portuguese research landscape has undergone a profound transformation in the last fifteen years. In particular, the creation in 1995, for the first time in Portugal, of the Ministry for Science and Technology and the definition by the government of a strategic vision and the decision of assigning a high priority to R&D has contributed for the reinforcement and development of the Science and Technology System. The introduction, in 1996, of a systematic evaluation process (every three years) based on international and independent panels and a more active international participation and cooperation have contributed to increase the international awareness regarding the science produced in Portugal and hence to increase the international reputation of our scientific community.
At the same time Portugal has benefited from considerable structural funds for Science and Technology through successive QCAs. Observing the evolution of some key figures along time can monitor the results of these changes.

The following table presents the figures for a few indicators that show the modifications undergone by the national scientific and technological system.

The evolution is characterized by a significant growth of the human and financial resources allocated to research (the reduction observed in 2003 was due to changes on the public policies, however, this trend has been completely reversed by the present government that has given again a high priority to Science, Technology and Innovation).

In fact, the creation of a considerable sector of non-–profit private research organizations, the enlarged capacity to train new researchers and to participate in national and international research programmes as well as in European and international academic networks was determined by the demanding requisites and goals set to the university based research units and reinforced with the emergence of the Associate Laboratories (reference institutions which have been ranked as excellent units by the international evaluation panels).


The dimension of the NSTS (measured by the total I&D personnel) more than doubled (from 10,883 FTE in 1988 to 25,529 FTE in 2003) in the last fifteen years. The number of PhDs more that triplicate, in the same period, as did the scientific production internationally cited (400 articles per inhabitant and year, representing 0.56% of the total number of articles worldwide in 2003). The umber of researchers per thousand active workers is 3.5 in 2003 (OCES, 2005).

In 2003, the contribution to the R&D expenses of the private sector was 0.24% of GDP. Without the fundamental contribution of the economic private sector, namely the industry, it will not be possible to sustain the growing qualified manpower of productive employment in R&D – economic, social and political sustainability of this level of effort has to result from a global effort. It is in this context that the present government has challenged the economic sector to triplicate their contributions until 2009, in order to achieve 0,75% of GDP.

The fast scientific and technological development of the country is hence a national priority and goals are defined aiming at recovering the lag as compared to developed countries. This is the engagement of the present government towards Science. It translates into a set of values for the indicators currently used for measuring the scientific and technological development of countries.

The following goals are pointed out:

-

To reach 5.5 researchers (FTE) per thousand active workers (in 2003 the number was 3.5 in Portugal and 5.5 in EU25)
-

To change from 1,000 to 1,500 doctors per year, increasing also the percentage of PhD in Sciences and Engineering
-

To increase by 50% the scientific production internationally cited, growing from 400 to 600 scientific publications per million of inhabitant
-

To triplicate the number of patents registered at the European US Patent Offices (in 2003 the figures were 4.1 and 1.3 per million of inhabitants, respectively)

To attain these goals it is necessary to launch several programmes, as well as mobilizing the whole country, in particular scientists and their organizations.

The proposed orientations aim at an enlarged participation in this movement that also implies renovation and expansion of the social base of the scientific and technological development in Portugal, through the direct involvement of scientific and technological professions, private and public organizations, as well as students and their families and the population in general. The growing appropriation of scientific and technological culture is, necessarily, one of the pillars of these orientations.

The five orientations are:

-

To invest in Knowledge and scientific and technological competence, measured at the highest international level
-

To invest in the human resources and in the Scientific and Technological Culture
-

To invest in public and private R&D organizations, in their reinforcement, responsibility, internal organization and networked infrastructure
-

To invest in internationalisation, strictness and evaluation
-

To invest in the economic valuation of research


A large range of measures are launched to enforce these orientations that will require an increase of the 2007 budget awarded by the Government to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education in the amount of 250 Meuros as compared to 2006 budget. This increment to Science and Technology budget must be extended to 2008 and 2009, till set goals have been reached.

In the framework of this “Engagement to Science” a complete and profound revision of the network of scientific organizations will take place in order to ensure the reliability and the quality of the national scientific and technological system, by international standards, in the context of accelerated growth.

Goals to be attained will be defined for the organizations adequate to the their mission, in particular in the technological areas and engineering, in respect to external investment too be attracted, to the minimum level of participation of enterprises in their activities or in common projects and to the intensity of referral to services provided or to scientific and technological dissemination. In applied science areas, the majority of research contracts will have to take the form of research projects in consortia with enterprises.

Finally, the structure of the Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia) will be reinforced to ensure its role of institutional reference and warranty of the evaluation and financing system and to enable its capacity to attract internationally recognized authorities in R&D evaluation and management while a State foundation.

WOMEN AND SCIENCE
In the opening session of the 
							first conference of the
Portuguese Association of Scientist Women
,
Mariano 
								Gago, Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education
pointed the 
							lack of human resources in Science and Technology in the European Union as a 
							barrier to the development of a more competitive knowledge based society.
His words were:
“In 2010, according to the Lisbon Strategy 8 in each 1000 Europeans should 
								pursue research careers while only 5 make this professional choice now. Today, 
								we know and all economic studies state that Europe will need about half a 
								million of scientists to maintain its level of competitiveness and of qualified 
								employment. Where will they come from? They hardly will come from other than 
								zones of the European society that now are not employing scientists, in 
								particular
women scientists
. If the number of women scientists would 
								increase from 10% to 15%, a great deal of the problem would be solved”.
In the European area,
women are 
								the majority of the Higher Education students
but they are too the 
							minority of those who opt for a research career. This is a reality in the 
							largest Member States of the European Union.
The Minister Gago continued
: 
								“We are aware that today in Europe
the number of Women in science is very small
and that without solving this problem in many European countries, in fact in 
								most of them, it is not possible to expect a significant raise in the number of 
								researchers in Europe. People may not be aware of this fact but the percentage 
								of women scientists that work in a country like Germany does not overpasses 
								16%. Fortunately,
in Portugal the situation is different
. The situation 
								in Portugal is one of the best in whole Europe. According to the latest 
								statistics,
Portugal has 43% of women scientists
and if we think in 
								terms of scientists less than 40 years old we have about the same number of man 
								and women.»
The Minister continues:
“why are 
								politicians concerned by this problem? Obviously, by moral and political 
								reasons, then because it is awkward (the least we can say) that women be 
								exclude from scientific professions in so many countries. Why are they 
								excluded? Because conciliating a demanding job like scientist with maternity 
								and family life, is very difficult in those countries. At the moment, this is 
								considered a serious problem in Europe.”
Aware of the gap existing in Portugal by the absence of a forum 
							where Women Scientists could optimise their capacity of intervention in the 
							society in an organized way, a group of scientists founded on the 4
th
of November 2004 the
Portuguese Association of Women Scientists – AMONET.
The Association is inspired by the principles expressed in the 
							Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in
European Constitution,
namely 
							in what concerns eliminating all kinds of discrimination and the promotion of 
							equal rights and opportunities for women and men.
The conference to which refer the words of the Minister of 
							Science, Technology and Higher Education was the first public act of the 
							Association.
Lídia Ferreira
, 
								Vice-president of the association
said:
«In spite of the large percentage of women, their participation in the society 
								is minor. When will we see women in power or in political careers? As you know, 
								the percentage is very low. And, even in science, if we look at the statistics, 
								the number of women that reach top or deciding positions in their career is 
								low. Moreover, in spite of the 50% of scientists who have international 
								recognition and prestigious CVs in specific fields being women, they are seldom 
								invited to participate in discussions concerning their specific field. This 
								happens because power is in men’s hands in most places.»
Data recently published in “She 
							Figures 2006” by EUROSTAT confirm the statements made by the Minister Mariano 
							Gago, with Portugal occupying the fourth place in the ranking of countries with 
							more women in science in Europe. Graphics also show that Portugal is one of the 
							most advanced countries in what concerns parity.

PORTUGUESE RESEARCH POLICY
The Portuguese research landscape has undergone a profound transformation in the last fifteen years. In particular, the creation in 1995, for the first time in Portugal, of the Ministry for Science and Technology and the definition by the government of a strategic vision and the decision of assigning a high priority to R&D has contributed for the reinforcement and development of the Science and Technology System. The introduction, in 1996, of a systematic evaluation process (every three years) based on international and independent panels and a more active international participation and cooperation have contributed to increase the international awareness regarding the science produced in Portugal and hence to increase the international reputation of our scientific community.
At the same time Portugal has benefited from considerable structural funds for Science and Technology through successive QCAs. Observing the evolution of some key figures along time can monitor the results of these changes.

The following table presents the figures for a few indicators that show the modifications undergone by the national scientific and technological system.

The evolution is characterized by a significant growth of the human and financial resources allocated to research (the reduction observed in 2003 was due to changes on the public policies, however, this trend has been completely reversed by the present government that has given again a high priority to Science, Technology and Innovation).

In fact, the creation of a considerable sector of non-–profit private research organizations, the enlarged capacity to train new researchers and to participate in national and international research programmes as well as in European and international academic networks was determined by the demanding requisites and goals set to the university based research units and reinforced with the emergence of the Associate Laboratories (reference institutions which have been ranked as excellent units by the international evaluation panels).


The dimension of the NSTS (measured by the total I&D personnel) more than doubled (from 10,883 FTE in 1988 to 25,529 FTE in 2003) in the last fifteen years. The number of PhDs more that triplicate, in the same period, as did the scientific production internationally cited (400 articles per inhabitant and year, representing 0.56% of the total number of articles worldwide in 2003). The umber of researchers per thousand active workers is 3.5 in 2003 (OCES, 2005).

In 2003, the contribution to the R&D expenses of the private sector was 0.24% of GDP. Without the fundamental contribution of the economic private sector, namely the industry, it will not be possible to sustain the growing qualified manpower of productive employment in R&D – economic, social and political sustainability of this level of effort has to result from a global effort. It is in this context that the present government has challenged the economic sector to triplicate their contributions until 2009, in order to achieve 0,75% of GDP.

The fast scientific and technological development of the country is hence a national priority and goals are defined aiming at recovering the lag as compared to developed countries. This is the engagement of the present government towards Science. It translates into a set of values for the indicators currently used for measuring the scientific and technological development of countries.

The following goals are pointed out:

-

To reach 5.5 researchers (FTE) per thousand active workers (in 2003 the number was 3.5 in Portugal and 5.5 in EU25)
-

To change from 1,000 to 1,500 doctors per year, increasing also the percentage of PhD in Sciences and Engineering
-

To increase by 50% the scientific production internationally cited, growing from 400 to 600 scientific publications per million of inhabitant
-

To triplicate the number of patents registered at the European US Patent Offices (in 2003 the figures were 4.1 and 1.3 per million of inhabitants, respectively)

To attain these goals it is necessary to launch several programmes, as well as mobilizing the whole country, in particular scientists and their organizations.

The proposed orientations aim at an enlarged participation in this movement that also implies renovation and expansion of the social base of the scientific and technological development in Portugal, through the direct involvement of scientific and technological professions, private and public organizations, as well as students and their families and the population in general. The growing appropriation of scientific and technological culture is, necessarily, one of the pillars of these orientations.

The five orientations are:

-

To invest in Knowledge and scientific and technological competence, measured at the highest international level
-

To invest in the human resources and in the Scientific and Technological Culture
-

To invest in public and private R&D organizations, in their reinforcement, responsibility, internal organization and networked infrastructure
-

To invest in internationalisation, strictness and evaluation
-

To invest in the economic valuation of research


A large range of measures are launched to enforce these orientations that will require an increase of the 2007 budget awarded by the Government to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education in the amount of 250 Meuros as compared to 2006 budget. This increment to Science and Technology budget must be extended to 2008 and 2009, till set goals have been reached.

In the framework of this “Engagement to Science” a complete and profound revision of the network of scientific organizations will take place in order to ensure the reliability and the quality of the national scientific and technological system, by international standards, in the context of accelerated growth.

Goals to be attained will be defined for the organizations adequate to the their mission, in particular in the technological areas and engineering, in respect to external investment too be attracted, to the minimum level of participation of enterprises in their activities or in common projects and to the intensity of referral to services provided or to scientific and technological dissemination. In applied science areas, the majority of research contracts will have to take the form of research projects in consortia with enterprises.

Finally, the structure of the Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia) will be reinforced to ensure its role of institutional reference and warranty of the evaluation and financing system and to enable its capacity to attract internationally recognized authorities in R&D evaluation and management while a State foundation.

WOMEN AND SCIENCE
In the opening session of the 
							first conference of the
Portuguese Association of Scientist Women
,
Mariano 
								Gago, Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education
pointed the 
							lack of human resources in Science and Technology in the European Union as a 
							barrier to the development of a more competitive knowledge based society.
His words were:
“In 2010, according to the Lisbon Strategy 8 in each 1000 Europeans should 
								pursue research careers while only 5 make this professional choice now. Today, 
								we know and all economic studies state that Europe will need about half a 
								million of scientists to maintain its level of competitiveness and of qualified 
								employment. Where will they come from? They hardly will come from other than 
								zones of the European society that now are not employing scientists, in 
								particular
women scientists
. If the number of women scientists would 
								increase from 10% to 15%, a great deal of the problem would be solved”.
In the European area,
women are 
								the majority of the Higher Education students
but they are too the 
							minority of those who opt for a research career. This is a reality in the 
							largest Member States of the European Union.
The Minister Gago continued
: 
								“We are aware that today in Europe
the number of Women in science is very small
and that without solving this problem in many European countries, in fact in 
								most of them, it is not possible to expect a significant raise in the number of 
								researchers in Europe. People may not be aware of this fact but the percentage 
								of women scientists that work in a country like Germany does not overpasses 
								16%. Fortunately,
in Portugal the situation is different
. The situation 
								in Portugal is one of the best in whole Europe. According to the latest 
								statistics,
Portugal has 43% of women scientists
and if we think in 
								terms of scientists less than 40 years old we have about the same number of man 
								and women.»
The Minister continues:
“why are 
								politicians concerned by this problem? Obviously, by moral and political 
								reasons, then because it is awkward (the least we can say) that women be 
								exclude from scientific professions in so many countries. Why are they 
								excluded? Because conciliating a demanding job like scientist with maternity 
								and family life, is very difficult in those countries. At the moment, this is 
								considered a serious problem in Europe.”
Aware of the gap existing in Portugal by the absence of a forum 
							where Women Scientists could optimise their capacity of intervention in the 
							society in an organized way, a group of scientists founded on the 4
th
of November 2004 the
Portuguese Association of Women Scientists – AMONET.
The Association is inspired by the principles expressed in the 
							Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in
European Constitution,
namely 
							in what concerns eliminating all kinds of discrimination and the promotion of 
							equal rights and opportunities for women and men.
The conference to which refer the words of the Minister of 
							Science, Technology and Higher Education was the first public act of the 
							Association.
Lídia Ferreira
, 
								Vice-president of the association
said:
«In spite of the large percentage of women, their participation in the society 
								is minor. When will we see women in power or in political careers? As you know, 
								the percentage is very low. And, even in science, if we look at the statistics, 
								the number of women that reach top or deciding positions in their career is 
								low. Moreover, in spite of the 50% of scientists who have international 
								recognition and prestigious CVs in specific fields being women, they are seldom 
								invited to participate in discussions concerning their specific field. This 
								happens because power is in men’s hands in most places.»
Data recently published in “She 
							Figures 2006” by EUROSTAT confirm the statements made by the Minister Mariano 
							Gago, with Portugal occupying the fourth place in the ranking of countries with 
							more women in science in Europe. Graphics also show that Portugal is one of the 
							most advanced countries in what concerns parity.

Practical Information
Information on this page is outdated corresponding to data collected in 2005. It will not be updated and may still provide some useful information. Moving and updating practical information to the new euraxess.pt portal is one of our current priorities. At a later stage this will be followed by Jobs information. Both portals will coexist during a period of months and we intend to fully preserve the eracareers jobs data in the new setting or other portals operated by FCT. We invite you to browse
www.euraxess.pt
which is rapidly changing.
Find information about living conditions in Portugal. For further local 
						information we advise you to contact a Researcher’s Mobility Centre, preferably 
						the closest to your desired destination.
You may find useful to get general information about working and living in 
						Portugal on the following sites:

						information about this issue you can contact the Mobility Centre at the place 
						you intend to go as all Portuguese State Universities have a Mobility Centre.
Housing
Renting furnished houses or flats is not organised in a straightforward way. It 
						is better to contact the Mobility Centre close to the city you intend to go. In 
						fact, information is very local and personalised. However, to get an overview 
						of the market, you may browse the addresses given below of real state firms 
						that also act as intermediaries for this business.

See the list and localisation of the Portuguese Network of Mobility Centres. 
						There you can get local and personalised assistance. The Portuguese Mobility 
						Centres are members of the European Network of Mobility Centres ERA-MORE.
The mission of ERA-MORE is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information 
						and personalised assistance to all researchers and their families seeking 
						advice in issues relating to their move across borders. ERA-MORE Mobility 
						Centres provide information and assistance in matters such as entry conditions, 
						visas, work permits, recognition of diplomas, job opportunities, salaries, 
						taxation, pension rights, health care, social security, accommodation, day 
						care, schooling, language courses, access to culture of the host country and 
						IPR. Mobility Centres fulfil this task either directly, by providing direct 
						information and proximity assistance to the person(s) requesting help, or 
						indirectly, by directing the person(s) concerned the closest specialised 
						centre. There are currently about 200 Mobility Centres in 32 countries. In the 
						second half of 2006 about 16.000 researchers got help from ERA-MORE.
